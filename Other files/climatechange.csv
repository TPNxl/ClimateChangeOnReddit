"85","c96z421","2","0","t3_1bgh5a","That's pretty lame hyperbole at the end, but the financial costs are the main reason we're not going to ever address climate change in a meaningful way. 

At the moment, the economy of the world runs on fossil fuels. And many of the largest companies in the world are those who deal in fossil fuels. Unfortunately, the economic benefit of fossil fuels is only possible because companies only have to pay half the cost. There is no fee for disposing of the waste products of fossil fuels - we just shoot them into the air. Because the disposal costs are negligible, fossil fuels are the cheapest way to ""generate"" and move energy around. 

No company is going to support a drastic increase in their operating costs due to carbon emission regulation. No country is willing to do this either, as it would be immensely disruptive to the economic systems we've relied upon for the last 60-80 years or more. Non-carbon based energy systems would be quite competitive with fossil fuels if the full cost of fossil fuels was required to be paid. However, that's just not going to happen. 

It has nothing to do with your bawling about ""Are we really soo absorbed in the money..."" and everything to do with the fact that there is no practical way to overhaul our world-wide economy to fix it being based on only half the cost of a product. Add in that some of the largest companies in the world will be lobbying against such a change, it it's not going to happen. 

The only hope for change is to make renewables more efficient than fossil fuels. The primary block to this is an inability to store and transport this energy in a way that is comparably efficient to fossil fuels. Once that technology is developed, renewable energy sources will be substantially more competitive. But as it is now, a train-car filled with batteries contains waaaaaay less energy than a train car filled with coal. You're not going to change the basis of the world's economy with that sort of efficiency. ","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_1bgh5a",1364915172,2013-04-02 15:06:12,"internet_sage"

Carbon Tax - Why choose 'cap and trade' when the private AND public sectors both agree that a carbon tax would be more stable and more effective.

Recycling - Why push recycling as the top conservation strategy when the elimination of recyclable products through incentives/disincentives would negate the need for such a focus? Again, sexy isn't always best.

Passive House - While there are thousands of certified passive houses in Europe, we struggled to get the first one done last year (in Carmel, CA). The results show that these designs are as affordable (if not cheaper) than regular houses, so why not make them the standard?

Sea Level Rise &amp; ""Beach Nourishment"" - The feds spend hundreds of millions each year to protect rich people's beach houses that shouldn't be there in the first place. FEMA subsidizes the insurance on these places because the markey won't. Isn't the money better spent elsewhere, especially when we know that we'll have to eventually buy these people out anyway? Why not focus on the low-lying poor people and getting them to higher ground sooner rather than later?

Climate Literacy - A minority of States have adopted the climate curriculum recommendations published by DOE this year. What will be the consequences for our students in ten years? Twenty?

Climate and Public Health - Allergies, heat-related illness, wider-spread tropical disease, and increased mold are just a few of the consequences of a changing climate. What can we expect the public health consequences to be if we don't take serious action on climate change?

Food, Water, and Climate - These three things are intimately connected. Food production, water processing (and access to water), and food/water consumption all have serious climate consequences.

The largest coal mining complex in the world is very close to being developed in the Galilee Basin, in Queensland, Australia. There are many companies involved, each waiting to get their greedy hands all dirty in the Galilee. But only one that is crucial, that can stop this environmental catastrophe. It used to be called QR National but is now known as Aurizon.

Aurizon, a rail freight company specializing in coal, is about to provide financial capital to the debt-ridden Indian company GVK, allowing GVK to ‘develop’ the first 3 mine sites. Aurizon have thus far ignored pleas and representations from national and international environment organisations to stop this insanity. As they prepare to sign on the dotted line, it is time for us to act, to make demands!

From August 24, activists and citizens alike, in Australia and around the globe, are using their collective voice and actions to pull Aurizon back from this environmental insanity. Join them by signing up here.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_1ldq1n",1377855181,2013-08-30 09:33:01,"alferg"

"178","ccdr5jp","1","0","t3_1mx679","Wow, a petition! That's super cute. You are adorable. 

Climate change isn't something you can fix with a petition. You might as well try an interpretive dance. At least people will remember that longer than another online petition. 

The root cause of climate change is that we have built the world's economy on 2/3 of the energy cycle of fossil fuels. That's why we've done so well. We pay for extraction and refinement, shipping and storage, but we don't pay for waste disposal. (This is also why fossil fuels remain competitive against renewables and nuclear energy.) If we were to suddenly have to pay the full cost of fossil fuels, we'd see a worldwide economic collapse. That's what your cute little poll is asking for. 

Now you might come up with some sort of warbling sound to indicate that this isn't what you meant, but it really is. To ""stop"" climate change we have to stop carbon emissions right now. All of them. And even then we will have something like 50 more years of climate change as all the carbon we've put into the atmosphere slowly starts to settle back out. Anything less and we're in for hundreds of years of climate change. 

You can't possibly hope to kick legs out from under the world's economy with an online petition. Nobody is going to let that happen. You can't generally impact your own country's version of the X-Factor with an online petition. A global problem with a fix that shatters the global economy isn't going to be solved with significant changes even on a country level. For every country that decides to pay the full cost of fossil fuels another will just take over their manufacturing and shipping and sell the same products using the same or more energy, causing the same or more carbon release. This is already happening in China and India, and as **those** countries start clamping down on pollution, it's shifting to Africa. 

But if a poll makes you feel better, great, I guess. I'll finish my coffee and achieve a similar amount of difference. ","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_1mx679",1379940437,2013-09-23 12:47:17,"internet_sage"

Skeptic Argument: ""Climate sensitivity is low"" 	

AGW Proponent Response: Net positive feedback is confirmed by many different lines of evidence.

Counter-response: But it is disproven by observation.

xxxxxxxx

Skeptic Argument: ""Earth hasn't warmed as much as expected"" 	

AGW Proponent Response: This argument ignores the cooling effect of aerosols and the planet's thermal inertia. 	

Counter-response: Where were these cooling effects in the 80s and 90s? Remember, these supposed effects are only theoretical. It's funny how they are suddenly discovered once global warming stops for a few (15) years.

xxxxxxxx

Skeptic Argument: ""Global warming stopped in 1998, 1995, 2002, 2007, 2010, ????"" 	

AGW Proponent Response: Global temperature is still rising and 2010 was the hottest recorded.

Counter-response: Global temperature has not risen since 1998, and this is agreed by everyone - even the IPCC (they just don't like to talk about it much, obviously).

xxxxxxxx
	
Skeptic Argument: ""Climate's changed before"" 	

AGW Proponent Response: Climate reacts to whatever forces it to change at the time; humans are now the dominant forcing. 

Counter-response: The global temperature has not changed for fifteen years, so if humans are the dominant forcing, then there is apparently not much to worry about.

xxxxxxxx

Skeptic Argument: ""IPCC is alarmist"" 	

AGW Proponent Response: Numerous papers have documented how IPCC predictions are more likely to underestimate the climate response.

Counter-response: Predictions are predictions - but observation (ie facts) have PROVEN that the IPCC has over-stated the case.

xxxxxxxx

Skeptic Argument: ""CO2 limits will harm the economy"" 	

AGW Proponent Response: The benefits of a price on carbon outweigh the costs several times over.

Counter-response: Benefits of higher costs for energy are benefits for energy companies and governments - not the people. We all know that cheap energy has driven the global economy. 

xxxxxxxx

Skeptic Argument: ""It's a natural cycle"" 	

AGW Proponent Response: No known natural forcing fits the fingerprints of observed warming except anthropogenic greenhouse gases.

Counter-response: The climate has not responded to anthropogenic greenhouse gases in a way that the IPCC can explain. Climate is beyond the ability of modern science to explain it. We do know that the current temperature of the planet is by no means the warmest - the planet has been way hotter than it is today.

xxxxxxxx
 
Skeptic Argument: ""Models are unreliable"" 	

AGW Proponent Response: Models successfully reproduce temperatures since 1900 globally, by land, in the air and the ocean. 

Counter-response: It is easy to make models predict the past - but the recent models have failed to predict the future - as factual observation of global temperature etc. has very clearly shown.

No, I'm talking about the ARGO network that gives us figures for up to 2000 meters of depth. The data is quite clear: the oceans have continued to accumulate heat at an increasing pace.

We started pumping massive amounts of CO2 in the air in the second half of the 19th century, and continued in the early 20th century. I don't know where you got the idea that none of that warming was due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases, but it's clear you have no idea what you're talking about.

Please don't be an idiot. I base my position on the current state of the scientific research, not ""scientists on TV"".

Yes, which is why we are almost certain the warming is man-made, because that is what the evidence tells us.

CAGW is not a real scientific term, it is a fake expression invented by climate science deniers to make those who accept the scientific consensus seem exceedingly alarmist.

When I saw Al Gore's movie - 'An Inconvenient Truth', I swallowed it whole. I believed. The piece of information which caused me to start asking questions was to do with the lag shown by the ice core samples. 

In the movie, Gore shows a clear link between CO2 and global temperature... the graph appears to fit together perfectly. Al Gore shows us how current CO2 levels are currently rising, and how they are higher than ever before... he has to use a crane to point to the new CO2 levels on the graph... 

He admits that the relationship between CO2 and temperature is complicated, but he says that when CO2 goes up, so does the temperature.

However, he does not mention the 600-100 year lag.

In case you are unaware of it, the ~800 year lag is undisputed even by CAGW proponents. What has been found is that temperature rises of the past have driven rises in CO2 (and not the other way around) - temperature rises, and then the CO2 rises a few hundred years later. 

The CAGW proponents argue that this is evidence of CO2 leading global temperature because the increased CO2 was pushing the temperature rises - but to state this as fact is silly; it is possible, but not provable... The fact is that every time the graph takes a turn, it is temperature which turns first and CO2 that follows. It is definitely good evidence of global temperature driving CO2, but not the other way round. 

When I saw Gore's movie, the one part of it that stood out to me, the one part that made me think that this whole thing was inevitable, was this part of the movie. It just seemed so clear cut until I did my own research. Then I looked at other evidence - the scientific consensus (there is no such thing as a scientific consensus - the term is an oxymoron, but you know what I mean), and there are a LOT of scientists who don't believe in CAGW. Then I looked at the temperature rise in the '80s and '90s - but that looks very similar to the rise in the 20s and 30s - before all this massive scale CO2 production... For every CAGW argument, there is a counter-argument that totally devalues it. What I found was that people who believe in CAGW generally have a religious fervor about them, and don't have a deep understanding of the ""science"" because they ""have faith"" in the scientists (you'd be surprised how many times people say they have faith in scientists - it is pretty funny because most of them are atheists)... Talking to some people about global warming is like trying to deny the holocaust - automatically, people get aggressive and start thinking you are some right wing, fundamentalist nutbag, paid off by the oil companies. But the truth is, the energy companies wrote cap and trade policies and are licking their lips at the idea of selling less energy for more money. And governments are all about having more control over energy. And there are many unscrupulous scientists out there (any intellectually honest person who studied the climategate affair properly will understand that some of the leading climate scientists have no real credibility any more) who are willing to take grant money to make a climate model that shows warming in the future.

In the end, the climate models are all the CAGW proponents had left to state their case... and now they have been shown to be wrong - so what does the IPCC do? It raises its certainty of CAGW from 90% to 95%. Amazing. 

Don't worry about insulting me - it happens all the time and I happen to be an asshole sometimes, so I probably deserved it. 

As far as making claims - the only claim I make is that CAGW has no solid scientific (observable) evidence. I'm not the one trying to say that CO2 is going to kill us all... the only way to go about this is that you show me your BEST evidence and I'll show you why it is not good evidence... which I'll be happy to do.

And secondly, you are basically saying that the consensus makes it true (or, extremely likely) - so you are contradicting yourself.

&gt;And secondly, you are basically saying that the consensus makes it true (or, extremely likely) - so you are contradicting yourself.

I'm *not* saying that, and I specifically said the contrary.

&gt;The best response is to say something like ""yes, you are right. the consensus means nothing, it is only the facts that matter

The consensus *doesn't* mean nothing. It is a good indicator that the science isn't controversial among experts - and it isn't.

&gt;If one fact disproves the entire consensus, then so be it, that is science.

Too bad for you no fact does.

&gt;But no, you still cling to the consensus.

I don't. I actually understand the science you so tenaciously remain ignorant of.

&gt;I'm all about facts and real-world evidence

Apparently not.

&gt; I'm your worst fucking nightmare

There's no need to be this way.

&gt;Yes, NASA who agree that man-made climate change is real, and that it represents a significant threat...As for the actual link, that doesn't support your position, it supports mine. If you're going to continue shooting yourself in the foot, then you don't really need me.

Why does it matter what NASA believe? Opinions do not matter when it comes to science... in fact, they just get in the way. The data is what matters - observable data. Of course NASA believes in CAGW - NASA is government funded and therefore has to - just like the MET Office, the BBC and the IPCC - this is just common sense - government funded opinions are not credible... it's like saying the CIA doesn't lie, or that there WERE WMDs in Iraq, or that the Gulf Of Tonkin incident really DID happen... why would anyone listen to the opinion of a government-funded body and take it as fact? It doesn't make sense. The first business of government is lying. History has repeatedly shown us this.

&gt;Me: ""you are basically saying that the consensus makes it true (or, extremely likely) - so you are contradicting yourself."" // You: I'm not saying that, and I specifically said the contrary.

So you are saying the consensus makes it untrue? I don't think so... you repeatedly resort to talking about the consensus... But the consensus doesn't matter - just like the consensus that the world was cooling in the '70s (see my previous link), this is just a consensus - there is nothing scientific about it... it is driven by politics and money and it is no good trying to hide behind it, because like I say, I don't care about a consensus.

You are right, in part, but misses one point. Temperature rise does correctly drive Co2 emissions from the permafrost, oceans and so on. Thereafter the released Co2 amplifies the temperature rise, constituting for 80-90% of the rise in temperature. And yes, there is a lag between increasing amounts of Co2 in the atmosphere and the oceans (that absorb much as part of the natural carbon cycle) and that's why we will, even if all ""unnatural"" emissions would stop today, see increasing temperatures in decades and probably centuries to come. What we can do, and to my opinion should do, is to lessen this by the best means available. This is a common misinterpretation of Lorius (1990), have a look at later publications from Petit (2000) or Barnola (2003).

Also, yes, scientific consensus is per definition an oxymoron - however, surveys (peer-reviewed) scientific literature shows a 98% support for the reality of AGW, so does 19 national academies of science across the globe.

If scientific reports or empirical case studies done through scientific methods are anecdotal evidence, then what are media reports?

Thoroughly unimpressive. The actual numbers show that [in the 70s scientific articles predicting global warming outnumbered those predicting cooling](http://www.skepticalscience.com/ice-age-predictions-in-1970s-intermediate.htm).

&gt;Why does it matter what NASA believe?

You're the one who quoted them in the first place.

&gt;The data is what matters observable data.

...and the data supports AGW theory, including a climate sensitivity between 2 and 4C with a likeliest value just under 3C.

&gt;Of course NASA believes in CAGW

CAGW is not an actual scientific term. It is a make-believe term used by climate science deniers, an ad hominem attack to make those who agree with the consensus appear to be unnecessarily alarmist.

If you disagree then please define what you mean *exactly* by ""catastrophic."" It is much too vague a word to be useful in a scientific debate.

&gt;NASA is government funded and therefore has to 

That is not a logical argument, but pure conspiracy theory.

&gt;So you are saying the consensus makes it untrue? 

No, I'm saying the consensus doesn't make it true or untrue. Please try to pay attention, this is pretty basic stuff.

&gt; just like the consensus that the world was cooling in the '70s (see my previous link)

There was no such consensus in the 70s, and you link didn't provide any evidence there was. It is simply more disinformation from ""Steven Goddard"", an anonymous climate disinformer with zero credentials and even less credibility.

If you are talking about localized weather variations, then it is pretty much anecdotal as far as I'm concerned... you can always find an anomaly somewhere - it's not hard. 

&gt;overall the temperature is rising

I think I can challenge this. It is true, but it is not true. Over the last 150 years, it is true. Over the last 15 years, it is not true. But that isn't the point - the point is that there is no good scientific evidence for CAGW.

I'm sorry, but you're not making sense here. The ""C"" in the non-scientific acronym ""CAGW"" refers to ""Catastrophic"", right? In other words, you's asking for evidence *for something that has not yet happened*. We're talking about a threat, a potential danger, therefore something that is in the future.

Your question can be interpreted in many ways, i.e. ""do you have evidence the predicted warming will be catastrophic"", which depends entirely on what you mean by ""catastrophic"". Since I'm not interested in using such emotionally-laden, imprecise word I simply stated what the science tells us, i.e. that we're facing 3 to 5C of warming by 2100 if we continue on the current track.

Now, perhaps what you asked for was whether we *will* see 3 to 5C of warming (nevermind whether that is catastrophic or not), and evidence supporting this. I suggest to read up on what the most likely valuse for Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity are, then consider that there's as much chance of having the high value be the right one as there is the low value.

Now, unless you have evidence that all of those ECS studies are wrong, we have to assume that climate sensitivity is likely to be just under 3C. That means about 4C of warming by 2100.

If you disagree with the current science, it's up to you to provide evidence your disagreement is based on scientific evidence.

&gt;especially in the light of the fact that the IPCC's predictions on the global temperature rise in the last few years have been largely way off.

That's incorrect. Models aren't designed to model short-term trends. Also, the slowdown, a temporary phenomenon, only concerns 5% of the entire warming.

An appeal to authority is only a logical fallacy if the authority is not an expert on the given subject (i.e. a legitimate authority).

Since the CRU is in fact a legitimate authority on the subject, there is nothing wrong with trusting them on this (barring any actual evidence that they are wrong).

Please read up on what an Appeal to authority is. I can tell you that just about every definition you'll find on the Internet will mention it is only a fallacy if the authority isn't an expert on the subject, or if the argument is that the authority is infallible (which isn't an argument I made - I trust them, that doesn't mean I believe there is no chance they could be wrong).

&gt;The CRU are suspect given past actions.

Not with regards to the science. All the independent inquiries into Climategate showed the science wasn't fraudulently manipulated. Did they act in an unprofessional manner? Sure, but anyone would when continually harassed with frivolous FoI requests.

Since the CRU is not suspect with regards to the science, and that you already accept HadCRUT3 as a source, you do not appear to have any rational arguments to distrust the quality and accuracy of HadCRUT4.

&gt;I wouldn't hold them up as paragons of trustworthiness.

That is not any kind of evidence that they are not trustworthy.

I am not sure who these people are that are ready to give up their lifestyle to fix the earth. I do not know my great great grandparents and I am happy about that. They did not give a shit what they left us so to be honest, I do not care about 4 generations down from me, I will never know them and they may not have my values.So to all the climate change people out there, get another minority public perception and stop people from glassing and king hitting people; kills more than the climate, Their life is finished, without climate change interfering.

&gt;**So, What is the Contribution of Waste Heat to Measured Warming?**
&gt;This would not be an easy question to answer. I’ve assumed that the waste heat generated in the U.S. is spread evenly across the U.S., whereas it is actually much more concentrated where people are. Of course, thermometers are also placed where people are, so they are more apt to measure the effects of this waste heat.
&gt;
&gt;Even the Climate Reference Network of “well-sited” thermometers are, for the most part, not that far from local economic activity…especially in the eastern U.S. I’ve looked at every one of the 100+ sites in Google Earth (most of are actually visible, with their distinctive trio of bright white thermometer solar shields), and relatively few of them are what you would call “remote”.
&gt;
&gt;Unless I have made a serious error in my back-of-the-printer-paper calculations (which wouldn’t be the first time), I would say that humanity’s generation of waste heat can’t be ignored in the discussion of observed land surface warming trends.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_1t3uiu",1387472439,2013-12-19 17:00:39,"Will_Power"

WHat we're currently experiencing is a result of warm air not moving toward the arctic at the rate that it had been. In order for air to move poleward it must, of course, be warm. While the pacific was experiencing an extended El Nino cycle there was a greater than normal heating of the tropics and therefore much more warmth was moving north over that period. So much was moving north that we saw the result as extrensive melting. 

Now that we've been in ENSO nuetral for most of the time since August 2010 the heating of the tropics has been in decline. That means that there is little high pressure pushing north. Without such pressure there is nothing to push the polar air south so it just moves in the vortex with little change over months.

The skeptical politicians even on the republican side are a small minority.

Most climate supporters consider skeptics to be idiots who deny science and facts or paid mis-informers so there actually hasn't really been much in way of an open debate.

The mainstream media is also strongly in favour of UN view of climate change so no debates tend to happen there either.

The only debates you can really have on the issue is in the blogosphere and the internet.

But if your asking whether or not there are still skeptics the answer is yes and many.

Due to the lack of debates most supporters of climate change actually don't know what skeptics actually think about climate change, how can the gap be bridged if people can't discuss with one another?

McGill University | March 3, 2014 

In the mid-1970s, the first available satellite images of Antarctica during the polar winter revealed a huge ice-free region within the ice pack of the Weddell Sea. This ice-free region—or polynya—stayed open for three full winters before it closed.

Subsequent research showed that the opening was maintained as relatively warm waters churned upward from kilometers below the ocean’s surface and released heat from the ocean’s deepest reaches. But the polynya—which was the size of New Zealand—has not reappeared in the nearly 40 years since it closed, and scientists have since come to view it as a naturally rare event.

Now, however, a study led by researchers from McGill University in Montreal suggests a new explanation: The 1970s polynya may have been the last gasp of what was previously a more common feature of the Southern Ocean, and which is now suppressed due to the effects of climate change on ocean salinity.

The McGill researchers, working with colleagues from the University of Pennsylvania, analyzed tens of thousands of measurements made by ships and robotic floats in the ocean around Antarctica over a 60-year period. Their study, published in Nature Climate Change, shows that the ocean’s surface has been steadily getting less salty since the 1950s. This lid of fresh water on top of the ocean prevents mixing with the warm waters underneath. As a result, the deep ocean heat has been unable to get out and melt back the wintertime Antarctic ice pack.

“Deep ocean waters only mix directly to the surface in a few small regions of the global ocean, so this has effectively shut one of the main conduits for deep ocean heat to escape,” said Casimir de Lavergne, a recent graduate of McGill’s Master’s program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences and lead author of the paper.

The scientists also surveyed the latest generation of climate models, which predict an increase of precipitation in the Southern Ocean as atmospheric carbon dioxide rises. “This agrees with the observations, and fits with a well-accepted principle that a warming planet will see dryer regions become dryer and wetter regions become wetter,” said Jaime Palter, a professor in McGill’s Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences and co-author of the study. “True to form, the polar Southern Ocean—as a wet place—has indeed become wetter. And in response to the surface ocean freshening, the polynyas simulated by the models also disappeared.”

In the real world, the melting of glaciers on Antarctica—not included in the models—has also been adding freshwater to the ocean, possibly strengthening the freshwater lid.

The new work can also help explain a scientific mystery. It has recently been discovered that Antarctic Bottom Water, which fills the deepest layer of the world ocean, has been shrinking over the last few decades. “The new work can provide an explanation for why this is happening,” said study co-author Eric Galbraith, a professor in McGill’s Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and a fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.

“The waters exposed in the Weddell polynya became very cold, making them very dense, so that they sunk down to become Antarctic Bottom Water that spread throughout the global ocean. This source of dense water was equal to at least twice the flow of all the rivers of the world combined, but with the surface capped by freshwater, it has been cut off,” Galbraith continued.

“Although our analysis suggests it’s unlikely, it’s always possible that the giant polynya will manage to reappear in the next century. If it does, it will release decades-worth of heat and carbon from the deep ocean to the atmosphere in a pulse of warming.”

The research was supported by the Stephen and Anastasia Mysak Graduate Fellowship in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery program, by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and by computing infrastructure provided by the Canadian Foundation for Innovation and Compute Canada.

2.  A Pigovian tax is designed to reduce consumption of the thing being taxed.  The problem with a carbon tax is that energy consumption is tied very tightly to GDP.  It cannot be assumed that the economy will keep chugging along when you make cheap energy, the one thing that makes modern civilization modern, expensive.

I'm not sure where you got those figures, but anyway, you might be interested in this tool:

http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/

Zoom in on the area that interests you and then select the sea level rise.  The default is 7 m, and the smallest value is 1 m, so it may not be terribly helpful.

As for temperature, the projection is that warming will be the greatest at the poles.  You could interpolate linearly from the equator to the south pole and take a wild guess that mean warming will be at 45°C S (or North), but that isn't a great method.  Regional temperature forecasts are very complicated things and depend very much on land use changes and other factors.

Not so much.  The latest IPCC report says the range for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 is 1.5-4.5°C, but that is *after* the climate reaches equilibrium, and we won't double CO2 from pre-industrial levels until around 2100, assuming we both have the fossil fuel resources to do so and we choose to rely on them for our primary energy source.

Well, the wide range for sensitivity gives us a great deal of uncertainty.  A better measure is Transient Climate Response, which is the temperature rise at the time of doubling (*not* after equilibrium is reached), assuming 1% per annum CO2 growth.  There is still a great deal of uncertainty even with this metric because we simply don't know how many fossil fuels we'll end up burning, or how many are economically viable.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_23m4yf",1398121566,2014-04-21 23:06:06,"Will_Power"

All of the academies of science (literally all of them) in every country, plus the United Nations International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), plus an overwhelming majority of scientists when evaluated individually (97% or more) have come to the conclusion that climate change is A) happening, and B) caused by human greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. If you have chosen not to believe the word of the scientists, it is my opinion that burden of proof is on you to explain why.

The basic proposition of climate change is that humans are releasing carbon dioxide (and methane, and some other crap, but mostly CO2) into the atmosphere, CO2 is a GHG, and GHGs warm the planet. It's not as if there aren't subtleties within that framework, but if you are going to disagree with the premise AND disagree with the international scientific community, I am curious as to why.

It's the best place to start, as it summarizes the physical science evidence. Highlights (quoting directly):

* Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased

* Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850. In the Northern Hemisphere, 1983–2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years (medium confidence).

* Ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010 (high confidence). It is virtually certain that the upper ocean (0−700 m) warmed from 1971 to 2010 (see Figure SPM.3), and it likely warmed between the 1870s and 1971.

* Over the last two decades, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been losing mass, glaciers have continued to shrink almost worldwide, and Arctic sea ice and Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover have continued to decrease in extent (high confidence).

* The rate of sea level rise since the mid-19th century has been larger than the mean rate during the previous two millennia (high confidence). Over the period 1901 to 2010, global mean sea level rose by 0.19 [0.17 to 0.21] m.

* The atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years. Carbon dioxide concentrations have increased by 40% since pre industrial times, primarily from fossil fuel emissions and secondarily from net land use change emissions. The ocean has absorbed about 30% of the emitted anthropogenic carbon dioxide, causing ocean acidification. 

* **Total radiative forcing is positive, and has led to an uptake of energy by the climate system. The largest contribution to total radiative forcing is caused by the increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 since 1750.**

"482","chd4au4","2","0","t3_252j6u","Take some time to read through this: http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf

It is a simplified version of the much longer technical report released by the IPCC last year.  The IPCC does none of its own research.  It consists of a large group of international scientists who volunteer their time to create a synthesis report that distills all of the work being done in the field into one cohesive document.  The editing process is extensive and there are thousands of reviewers that pour over and argue about every single sentence and figure in the report (a few of my professors took part in this review process, specifically in sections relating to the El Niño southern oscillation).

Another place to hear climate related news and cutting edge information is realclimate.org a site that is written by and run by actual climate scientists.

The basic rundown on why climate change is so heavily supported in the academic community is just a matter of physics.  The atmosphere is mostly transparent to visible light, so much of it reaches the earth's surface.  At night, the earth's surface radiates energy back upwards with an emission spectra that is determined by the surface temperature using the Stephan-Boltzmann law.  The peak of this emission spectrum is in the infrared region, which the atmosphere is NOT transparent to.  Certain gasses heavily absorb infrared radiation, water vapor, CO2, and methane being notable examples.  These gasses then re-emitt radiation themselves, also in the infrared spectrum, in all directions.  This is exactly what the glass plates in a greenhouse do (act transparent to visible light, non-transparent to IR), hence the term ""greenhouse effect"".  

The reason scientists are concerned with CO2 in particular is that in recent years it is having by far the largest forcing effect on the earth's energy budget (see figure SPM.5 in the ipcc link above).  This is due to two factors: the first is that we are rapidly altering the global carbon cycle by releasing huge deposits of sequestered carbon from underground into the atmosphere.  These reservoirs took hundreds of thousands/millions of years to form, yet we are re-releasing them into the atmosphere and oceans on the order of decades and centuries.  Secondly, CO2 absorbs several different bands within the IR spectrum and basically plugs the holes left by the other greenhouse gasses.  Water vapor, although technically a much larger forcing agent than CO2, is of little concern since the amount of water in the atmosphere is dependent on temperature.  Adding extra water to the atmosphere will just cause saturation and cause it to rain.  Likewise removing water from the atmosphere will naturally be counterbalanced by evaporation from the ocean surface (check out the Clausius-Clayperon relation if you want to get technical).  CO2 has no such relation, and in fact about half of the CO2 that we emit ends up in the atmosphere, the rest dissolves into the oceans, lowering the pH of the water and potentially causing serious ecological effects.


Because of how water behaves in the atmosphere, it is said to be a feedback rather than a forcing.  Increases in temperature are simply magnified by water vapor, since warmer air can hold more water.  With more water vapor you get more heating, and you get a feedback loop which increases the magnitude of other heating effects.  The opposite is true for cooling, a colder atmosphere can hold less water vapor and will cool down even more.

Of course all this is not happening in a vacuum.  Natural variability is still in play, it's just being ""pushed"" by increased radiative forcing due to greenhouse gasses and land use changes (less biomass means less sequestered carbon and more carbon in the atmosphere).  This is how even though temperatures have not been increasing rapidly in the past 15 years , we can still see climate change occurring (take a look at figure SPM.6 in the ipcc link). Analysis of the natural forcings on the earth's climate system tells us that the earth should be slightly cooling, due to solar cycles and orbital cycles of the earth.  In addition, the oceans have been absorbing much more heat than ""usual"" in a cyclic El Niño/La Nina related phenomenon.  What this adds up to is a relatively flat temperature graph in recent years despite human forcings.  Once natural variability starts its upswing, you can expect to see temperatures rising much more rapidly like they were earlier this century.

Edit: proofreading

Edit2: Here is the most famous and most comprehensive data set on atmospheric CO2 levels in the recent past, known as the [Keeling curve](http://www.wunderground.com/education/greenhouse/keelingcurve.gif).

Notice the natural variability (annual up and down cycles correlating to spring/fall in the northern hemisphere, where the majority of the earth's biomass is located), is being ""forced"" upwards by the addition of CO2 from underground.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_252j6u",1399588469,2014-05-08 22:34:29,"brianpv"

&gt;at this point the evidence for is so comprehensive/overwhelming

That may be true, but the average person does not understand this information and throwing them off of a cliff is not going to help matters in any way.

There are probably millions of people in the exact same situation as I am in and these types of reactions just make matters worse for the whole situation.

The post by brianpv answered a host of questions I had on specific issues I had read contradicting info on. His post has made me believe there may be truth to this even this early on. He blew one concern ""out of the water"" as far as I am concerned because his comment made sense. In other words, when I read it, I ""Got it"".

The reason it caught my attention is because I read this in the past.

&gt;Water vapor is 10X more powerful and much more plentiful than CO2 as a greenhouse gas (4% of atmosphere) – water vapor can decrease by…condensation/rain thus reducing the greenhouse effect well beyond the effect of .0011% (CO2 from man) of the atmosphere.

"492","chdaamh","5","0","t1_chd4slj","Well, I'm a little slow to get to everything, but I will include a couple sources regarding Climategate. I also wanted to mention that you seem to get a little offended when people have responded by saying things like ""all scientific organizations agree"" or ""overwhelming majority"" etc. etc. I just want to note that people are saying this not give you a hard time or to cast you in the minority. Rather, science is strengthened by its ability to be reproduced. When new reports come out, other scientists jump at the opportunity to test the conclusion, and attempt to debunk it. That's really how the scientific community works. So the fact that reports continue to come out confirming increased temperatures, and other scientific groups are able to reproduce this data, is just meant to show the strength of the conclusion. Also, it's hard to pull off a conspiracy when all the data is published for anybody to test, and when scientists from all around the world reach the same conclusion.

On to Climategate. In 2009, a hacker publicized 1,000 email conversations between scientists at the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, England. The IPCC used data from CRU in its 2007 report, but of course also used data from other sources as well, including NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The emails covered a whole range of topics during a 13-year period. Some of the emails are snarky about climate change skeptics. Some at first blush indicate a manipulation of numbers. This lead skeptics and conservative papers to mistrust the IPCC report. In response, CRU commissioned two inquiries to determine whether scientists at CRU had behaved appropriately. [Report Here](http://www.cce-review.org/pdf/FINAL%20REPORT.pdf).

That report is very thorough, but definitely way to long to casually read. Other more approachable sources are below.

[Factcheck](http://www.factcheck.org/2009/12/climategate/)

[Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/11/james-inhofe/inhofe-claims-cru-e-mails-debunk-science-behind-cl/)

[Union of Concerned Scientists](http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/solutions/fight-misinformation/debunking-misinformation-stolen-emails-climategate.html)

Basically, there are a number of reasons not to get too riled up about the emails. I don't really want to walk through each of them to discuss what is actually being said in them (that's what the report above is for). I think its best just to say that the CRU is just one of many sources that provide data regarding data. You could totally throw out everything from CRU and would get pretty much the exact same report and conclusion from the IPCC. The whole point of the IPCC is that it is collecting data from lots of sources to strengthen the conclusion.

Just to go over a one of the most discussed emails:

An email from 1999 written by CRU director Phil Jones discussed a now-famous study by Michael Mann published in Nature. The study included data for the famous ""[hockey stick graph](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/05/the-hockey-stick-the-most-controversial-chart-in-science-explained/275753/)."" In the email, Jones wrote ""I've just completed Mike's Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (i.e. from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 to Keith's to hide the decline."" That sounds pretty bad. But the quote needs some context. The problem here was that data about temperature is taken from different sources: actual measurements, ice cores, tree rings, etc. High-latitude tree ring data from 1960 to 1994 didn't match actual measured temperatures from the same location, even though the tree rings and measured temperatures had matched well from 1950-1959. The tree ring data seemed to show a decline in temperature after 1960, even though actual measurements showed otherwise. Jones had actually published a paper in 1998 about the ""divergence issue,"" also in Nature. The ""trick"" is not a deception; it simply means an explanation that overcomes what seems to be a contradiction. See more [here](http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/east-anglia-cru-hacked-emails-12-07-09.pdf). The data in the hockey stick graph has been confirmed by many other scientists, and reports relying on other data have also found a hockey-stick-like pattern. See [here](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/05/the-hockey-stick-the-most-controversial-chart-in-science-explained/275753/).

As far as being offended? Absolutely! If you treat me like I'm scum for simply asking a question, I will respond accordingly. Why can't someone just explain it instead of making snide remarks after and via these statements?

This is not the first time I have asked for guidance/help on this topic and not the first time I received rude and crude replies in person and online over the years, just like the first one in this thread (Thankfully they figured out I am asking for help and really want to know).

So, as a human, if every time I walk by you I slapped you in the face, what would you eventually do? Would you build up defenses against it? I bet you would...in fact, I know you would. I am starting to believe that this is the core of the problem with CC at the current time. There seems to be nothing available for the average person to read, learn and understand. Without understanding, there will always be division.

I have nothing against science, I am on a computer on the net and make my living with sciences. I use it all day everyday doing what I do for a living and living in general. My problem is not with science, it's the people who want me to accept it at face value and move along. This is not like Edison, Swan and a light bulb where you can see the light instantly. Some science is obvious, not so much with other things within science.

I did not get where I am today being a blind follower... I want to know why, always have. Now back to your post on CC.

Your prior post had some information that really grabbed me hard and I believe now that the skeptics have lied to everyone after a couple hours of reading and watching videos on the topic (C02 vs Water Vapor).

Your explanation of climategate makes sense, but in the news it was all finger pointing on both sides. Not one person took the time to explain it openly as you have. It looks really bad to the average person who does not have the education you obviously have.

I really appreciate your time and effort and do not take anything you guys are showing me lightly and even this early in has me leaning a bit towards CC now. I have much more research to do and will probably have a host of questions over the next few days.

Please don't take any questions the wrong way, I am really trying to sort things out and finding the facts.

&gt;...plus an overwhelming majority of scientists when evaluated individually (97% or more)...

That's false.  The questions asked of those scientists were whether CO2 is a GHG (it is) and whether humankind was a ""significant"" contributor to the warming over the 20th century.  Most climate skeptics answer yes to both, so the questions were pretty meaningless.  Also, you are appealing to authority, not answering the OP's questions.

&gt;have come to the conclusion that climate change is A) happening, and B) caused by human greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

It isn't a binary proposition.  Better questions are:

- How much of the observed warming over the 20th century was due to human emissions of CO2?

- How much future warming is likely?

The nuance to those questions goes well beyond a false dichotomy.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_252j6u",1399670643,2014-05-09 21:24:03,"Will_Power"
"499","che0467","2","0","t3_252j6u","The subject is very nuanced.  Maybe it would be helpful to frame this in terms of what is well known/understood and what isn't.

There is very wide agreement, let's call it ""consensus,"" that:

- The earth warmed by about 0.75°C (plus or minus a bit) during the 20th century.

- CO2 is a greenhouse gas.  Doubling CO2 will **directly** result in about 1°C of warming, all else being equal.  Of course the climate is a chaotic system, so all else will never be equal.  Total warming will depend on feedbacks, which I'll address below.

- Mankind emits a lot of CO2 via the burning of fossil fuels.  Some of this gets absorbed by the oceans; some of it leads to increasing biomass; the rest ends up in the atmosphere.

- Prior to the industrial revolution, atmospheric CO2 was about 280 ppm, which borders on the edge of plants dying off.

- Atmospheric CO2 today is around 400 ppm.  (A doubling of CO2 from preindustrial levels would be 560 ppm.)

It is generally accepted by most scientists, but not as widely as the previous list, that:

- The sun was the most active during the last 100 years as it was in the last 10,000 years.  There is much uncertainty around how much this influenced the climate, but there is agreement that some of the warming was attributable to the active sun.

- The oceans appear to contribute to both warming and cooling in a roughly 60 year cycle.  In other words, the present slow rate of warming and the slight cooling period from ~1940-1970 is/was due to the deeper oceans absorbing heat from surface waters, while the warming period from ~1970-2000 saw the ocean surface releasing heat.  I put this in the ""generally accepted"" category whereas a year ago I might have put this in the ""somewhat accepted"" category below.

- Feedbacks in the climate are net positive.  There are lots of feedbacks in the climate system, some positive, some negative.  The overall effect is thought to be positive.  The largest proposed positive feedback from warming is more evaporation leading to higher water vapor concentrations.  The measurements we have of past water vapor concentrations are far from ideal.  As far as we can tell, specific humidity over the last 50 years or so has indeed increased, but relative humidity has decreased.  So it is hard to nail down long term feedbacks, and that's a shame because that is the crux of the whole climate issue. 

- Related to the previous, the latest IPCC report has a ""likely"" range of ECS (equilibrium climate sensitivity) of 1.5-4.5°C.  ECS is the total rise in temperature per doubling of CO2 once all feedbacks are accounted for and there has been sufficient time for the climate system to reach equilibrium.

- GCMs (General Circulation Models) produce ECS values on the high end of that range.

- Observationally constrained Simple Climate Models (SCMs) produce values at the low end of that range.

It is somewhat accepted that:

- Economically recoverable fossil fuel reserves are lower than total fossil fuel reserves.  Some suggest that we can get about one doubling of CO2 from pre-industrial levels if we burn the economically recoverable stuff.  There is debate about what is economically recoverable and what is not.

- Aerosols have been much higher during the 20th century than in the past and have masked warming.  This is a tough one because there weren't good measurements of aerosols during the cooling period from ~1940-1970.  The favorite explanation for that cooling period a few years ago was that it was all aerosols.  This seems to have shifted to a less favorable explanation as the ocean cycle hypothesis gains momentum.

- There was a generally cool period known as the ""Little Ice Age"" that ended roughly during the 19th century.

So what's the bottom line?  The bottom line is that there is still a lot of uncertainty around how much temperatures will rise.  There are very few serious people who say that mankind has had **no** role in the observed warming, just as there are very few who say that **all** warming during the 20th century was due to mankind.  The wide range of possibilities for climate sensitivity is a huge deal.  If it's at the low end, there isn't much to worry about and some adaptive measures are all that's needed.  If they are at the high end, then mitigation is necessary.

The real unfortunate thing about climate change as a field of interest is that it is so damn politicized.  Those on the far right claim it's a hoax.  Those on the far left claim it is humanity's sole existential crisis.  The truth is somewhere in the middle.

The reason I have asked is because there have been reports over and over that we are on the down side of fossil fuels and have about 40 years of oil left. http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-science/peak-oil.htm

I have read many articles on this and I am asking if this is true, and if so and we do run out in 40 years, why would CC be a big deal? Once we run out, would it reverse itself fairly quick? If not, could you attempt to explain why?

"508","che5enb","1","0","t1_che5168","&gt;...this means there would be a cap on he damage we could do right?

Yes.  Keep in mind that oil is actually one of the three major fossil fuels, though.  Oil will peak (conventional oil already has) first, then natural gas, then coal.

&gt;I have read many articles on this and I am asking if this is true, and if so and we do run out in 40 years...

Just to clarify, peak oil isn't about running out, per se.  It's about a reduction of flow rate.  We'll use oil for a long time to come, but it gets too expensive for all but a few niche uses with time.

&gt;...why would CC be a big deal? 

This actually is a valid line of questioning.  Independent researchers like Gail Tverberg believe that climate change won't be a big deal because of a rapid decline in available fossil fuels, but that rapid decline will produce horrors all its own.  Others point out that fossil fuels are essentially self taxing; that is, the more you use, the more expensive they get.  On the other side there are those who think technical advances will allow us to get at most of the fossil fuels.  It's bizarre, because it's the political right saying that peak oil isn't a big deal because technology and the political left saying climate change is an existential crisis because... technology.  Very strange.

&gt;Once we run out, would it reverse itself fairly quick? If not, could you attempt to explain why?

The general feeling, I would put this in the ""generally accepted"" category above, is that CO2 has a long residency in the atmosphere.  In other words, if CO2 emissions stopped today, existing CO2 would hang around for a long time.  Some say thousands of years.  Since we don't reach equilibrium instantaneously, they say, warming will continue until equilibrium temperature is reached.

If you really want to delve into the math behind it, the radiative forcing from CO2 is logarithmic in nature.  That is, the last 10 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere have a larger effect than the next 10 ppm.  Of course that doesn't count so-called ""tipping points,"" which is the thing that some of the more nervous folks are most worried about.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_252j6u",1399686794,2014-05-10 01:53:14,"Will_Power"

•	Oh the dinosaurs lived in higher CO2 levels
Cui et al. 2011: Palaeocene–Eocene extreme global warming event occurred about 55.9 Myr ago (5 degrees C above average). Our simulations show that the peak rate of carbon addition was probably in the range of 0:3–1:7 Pg C yr􀀀1,much slower than the present rate of carbon emissions.

Julie Brigham-Grette et al 2013 last time when CO2 was that high it took close to 1 million years to go from 450 to under 300


Grasby et al. 2011; Sun et al. 2012: “The late Permian extinction, which kicked off roughly 250 million years ago, has a rather gruesome nickname: the Great Dying. Over 90 percent of the species in the oceans went extinct in the geological blink of an eye, and similar devastation took place on land. The remains of these eruptions, called the Siberian Traps, now cover about 2 million square kilometers of Russia. The rock formation is what's called a flood basalt, thought to be caused by a plume of hot mantle breaking through to the surface. The Siberian Traps may be the largest event of this sort we know about, and the dimensions are staggering: over 1,000 Gt (Gigatonnes) of magma were released during the eruptions that created them, and they are thought to have put material into a plume that rose over 40 kilometers into the atmosphere”…..ocean acification 
Knorr et al. 2011 found that the meiocene period (the warm period that many people refer to) was not warm because of the co2 but due to the placement of tectonic plates and vegetation patterns. The world has not always looked like it does now. Continents were closer together, and could have facilitated a larger tropical area since the ocean would have less of a regulating effect (think of big Australia…the center is a giant desert). 

•	The earth goes through natural cycles
Good job, so does my Mother, but that doesn’t mean I can’t make her more angry than she usually is on these cycles. 

•	CO2 today makes up only .004% of the atmosphere! That's nothing....how can CO2 make an entire planet hotter?!?!?
* Not every compound or element can be treated the same. That’s like saying 1 gram of Uranium can do the same amount of damage as 1 gram of Coal when really 1 gram of Uranium has the same potential energy as 3 tonns of coal

Morice et al. 2012: temperature anomalies have been occurring at increasing rates. So we just had this “Polar Vortex” in the Northern United States and people cried “Global warming is a hoax.” This could be exactly opposite and we were/have been warned that there would be more temperature anomalies (warmer OR colder than average temperatures), which is exactly what has been happening.

•	How can we possibly know what temperatures or levels of CO2 existed for prehistoric times?!?!
Ice core data: up to 750,000 years of data based on oxygen isotope ratios. We use carbon dating to see when a certain layer was put down in a glacier and then look at the isotopes to see if it was a warm period (one isotope ratio) or a cold period (a different ratio).
Limestone data (millions of years of data) is the product of diatom phytoplankton that have siliceous shells that fall and accumulate on the ocean floor. Scientists look at the isotopes and layers in limestone all over the world and use their knowledge and experiences to inform us. 

•	It was colder than average in [INSERT LOCATION], so climate change is bogus.
November was the 345th consecutive warmest month above average and the ocean has been warming for even longer (since it absorbs heat better than land). Australia has seen detrimental effects (devastating fires) from warming and just points out that GLOBAL warming is not just what happens in the United States. Just because it's colder than usual for a few days in the US, does not mean that it's cold EVERYWHERE.
•	Sea level hasn’t risen at all!!!!
sea level has risen 8 inches since 1880. Not much to worry about for most of us, but Pacific Islanders (such as Kiribati) have already had to move because their land has been encroached by the sea. May not affect you, but it does for some people. Although I encourage people to question/ be critical toward science (makes it that much better), it's also good to have an open mind.
Gehrels and Woodworth 2013: the rate in sea level rise has exceeded the rate of the Holocene and has been increasing since ~1925. AND THE RATE IS CURRENTLY ACCELERATING!
•	Where is all this so called warming going?!?!?
***the heating energy is adsorbed: 2.3% is in the atmosphere, 2.1% on continents, 0.9% in Glaciers &amp; ice, 0.8% arctic sea ice, 0.2% Greenland Ice Sheet, 0.2% Antarctic Ice Sheet……….and 93.4% in THE OCEAN (in particular the upper 300meters of the ocean; Lyman et al. 2010)

•	Temperature and CO2 data are all collected in cities and on top of volcanoes (Mauna Kea observatory), that data can’t be right.
Hawaii Ocean Time series (HOT) is the location of one of the longest data collection series. It's 200 North of Oahu, Hawaii (which is THE MOST isolated archipelago in the world away from any other human activity). The data collections agree with the Mauna Kea observatory data (CO2 up to 400ppm, pH is down 30%, Sea Surface temperature Anomalies occurring more than ever AND the ocean is warming because it absorbs heat more than hard crusty land

•	Even if the Earth is warming, we don’t know that humans cause it!

Imbers et al. 2013: tested the robustness of the climate change data using mathematical models using data on solar, volcanic, greenhouse gasses and sulfates, El Nino, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. They found that “in all instances, we conclude that human-induced changes to atmospheric gas composition is affecting global mean surface temperature changes.”


•	The sun has had more activity recently and the increased solar radiation is heating our planet.
Schurer et al. 2013: Solar forcings (temperature change based on solar activity) had little influence on the climate in the past millennium. 

•	We bought into Al Gore's lies (a POLITICIAN!) and he's making millions off this lie, scientists are paid to fake data or it's in their best interest.
Ok, here is my response to all of this Grant money for scientists. I have worked in 3 research labs (snail evolution, coral acidification and coral genetics) and only one of those labs had a large govt. (National Science Foundation) grant. I have seen national geographic grants, grants from the LOCAL WOMENS GARDENING CLUB and non-profit grants. Not everyone is a govt. agent out to make money. The people I have worked with are very passionate about their work and you make it seem like we just do it for money. 40% of grants go to the Universities and the rest goes to expensive molecular work. This isn't just pocket money.  Plus, the majority of money goes into studying human health…which makes sense. Most of the technology that marine biologists get to work with were made for health sciences (like the flow cytometer which was originally made for hospitals to screen blood, but now has tons of applications outside of health sciences).
not much money compared to everything else.
US military budget 2011: ~950 billion dollars
NASA budget for 2011: ~900 billion dollars

National Science Foundation (where govt. grants come from) for 2011: ~7 billion
Also, Al Gore  may not have spent his undergrad, graduate, doctorate, post doc learning about meteorology, geology, paleontology, marine biology, but the point is some people have. All that time and money is not wasted, and I don't expect a teacher, police officer, judge, construction worker, nurse, etc. to understand it all, just like they don’t expect me to know how to build a bridge, administer drugs, or knowing every local law. All I can do is try and teach those who have an open mind about what I have learned.

•	EXTRAS: Nature is telling us that climate change is happening.
Rosenweig 2008: found that “Each documented response is a ‘statistically significant’ signal that is beyond the natural internal variability of those systems.”

“Most (about 90% of the 29,500 data series, P=0.001) changes in these systems at the global scale have been in the direction expected as a response to warming. Ninety-five per cent of the 829 documented physical changes have been in directions consistent with warming, such as glacier wastage and an earlier spring peak of river discharge. For biological systems, 90% of the ,28,800 documented changes in plants and animals are responding consistently to temperature changes (mostly by means of earlier blooming, leaf unfolding and spring arrival). Warming in oceans, lakes and rivers is also affecting marine and freshwater biological systems (for example, changes in phenology, migration and community composition in algae, plankton and fish).”



A recent study by De'ath et al 2010 looked at reef building corals that are up to 500 years old. Corals lay down a calcium carbonate skeleton, and just like trees, we can look at their rings to determine their age. After the 1950s the study found that the corals had a significant drop in the rate of calcification (so each ring thereafter would be smaller and smaller).

There is one comment that you made that did surprise me and I want to address it.

&gt;and you make it seem like we just do it for money.

I never implied nor suggested that all or even most scientist are guilty of this. I believe if you take the time to read my post and answers to other comments you would have read the following.

&gt;I am not questioning the ground floor scientist, just the politically connected or controlled ones and the lapdog media on both sides. I trust neither one bit.

There are about a dozen scientist that I can name and point out personally that I have dealt with in person, sat with, argued with, debated with that are as corrupt as the day is long.

These are politically connected ""Leaders"" within FDA that I have had to deal with in the past and present and likely will have to deal with for the next few years at the least and possibly much longer. This is not opinion, it is fact.

I own an electronic cigarette company (one of several companies I own or own part of). You as a scientist can validate what I am about to tell you. The ""Smoke"" or combusted organic material is responsible for the vast majority of smoking related illnesses, not nicotine(you can look up the details). This was the peer reviewed science used to win billions in court against the major tobacco companies and led to most of today's anti-smoking legislation.

Why are they trying to ban them? It is scientist at FDA (Politically connected) that are attempting to ban them. They sit on the advisory boards for each field and have a load of influence and have lied and mislead the public on this product that may hold great benefit to smokers and bystanders across the globe with over 30 tests, trials and studies backing it thus far (Zero are negative in nature).

There are also scientific leaders in AMA, AHA, ALA and many other ""Organizations"" that are **headed** by scientist that also oppose the same science they used in the lawsuits to win billions against big tobacco, but when e cigarettes are concerned, that science seems to be ""Invalid"" to them. It is politically motivated. The CDC recently joined in the game. Pretty sorry for top level scientist....ya think?

PG (propylene glycol) is used in I.V. as a vehicle, in asthma inhalers, ventilation systems in hospitals to kill viruses, in most foods, cosmetics and much more. It's on FDA GRAS list (Generally recognized as safe) and has been pushed to the public as anti-freeze to scare smokers away and continue such programs to this day. You call that upstanding?

I know that most scientist are hard working and trusted people, but the politically connected (the few) are more corrupt than you could possibly imagine. I will trust you personally until you give me reason not to and I can dig and find conflicts of interest easily. In fact, I am so good at it that more political pressure from these same ""Scientist"", FDA and major pharmaceutical companies stopped press releases on electronic cigarettes from being syndicated across the web on PRNewsWire (Legitimate &amp; high cost PR distribution) because of myself and my company telling facts and exposing the names behind the corruption.

My free speech was abolished because of corruption and was told directly by the company reps from the News wire services my company used. I am not flying blind either, there are many scientist that support electronic cigarettes. Here is an example http://tobaccoanalysis.blogspot.com/

He is no rookie in the tobacco control field, read his bio in the sidebar of his site I linked to.

I talk to scientist several times a week as of right now as advisory support as I navigate through the corruption. I have never had one single scientist outside of government disagree with me (or the science &amp; experts with no conflict of interest) on the issues I deal with and most are just as bold as I am when confronting them. As you stated concerning professions being vastly different, I deal with different scientist in a different field and they will not give me an opinion on AGW because they stated they could not give a fair analysis. I understand this fully and it is why I am here asking questions now.

Like I stated earlier, I did not get where I am being a mindless idiot, so please don't treat me as one.

That was not a fair statement and you know it. Don't assume I do what I do for the money either, I am a professional marketer and businessman that only markets products or services that I believe will help people (help and/or save lives). Just so happens that when you market for the good of people, you do well without corruption.


Thanks for your informative post. It is sincerely appreciated and I will follow through and may even have questions for you in the future concerning this post and it's content and context.

Also, do you have any suggestions or possible solutions to AGW and the issues related? I would love to hear them.

&gt;...so what do you think would be possible solutions to our current CC problems and why?

I'm glad you asked, honestly.  It's something I've given a lot of thought to.  That doesn't mean I have it all figured it out or that I don't have blind spots, but what follows is my considered opinion.

First, and perhaps most importantly, we all need to take a deep breath.  The question of ""what should we do?"" often gets knee-jerk responses, which normally result in opposing knee-jerk responses.  I think we need to simply breath and think this thing through.

Next, I think we need to recognize that potential solutions to climate change and potential solutions to peak oil/coal/gas have some overlap.  Those are worth looking at.

After that, we need to not pretend that we have unlimited financial resources.  Everything we do will cost money, and once we choose to spend that money, we don't get to have that money to spend again.  We therefore need to get the most out of our money.

I will assume here that most people want to maintain some semblance of modern society.  I know there are a few who think we need to revert back to a low-energy way of life.  I respect that viewpoint, and I wish those who wish to so live the best of luck.  I don't think most people want to live that way, and I believe that modernity has done more good than harm for humans, so I would like to have that persist for future generations.

With those caveats, let me revert back to bullet points for my recommendations:

- While solar and wind are great for certain places at certain times, I do not believe they should be *the* general prescription for our energy needs.  Even very concerned climate scientists like Jim Hansen and Kerry Emanuel [agree on this point](http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists-letter/).  Solar is great for hot, sunny places like Phoenix.  I think everyone there should consider rooftop solar, especially businesses.  I think there are places where wind makes sense too; however, both solar and wind are diffuse and intermittent.  They are simply not suitable replacements for coal- or gas-generated electricity.  

- We would do well to electrify transportation as much as possible, but recognize that this will probably take a couple of decades.  I think this should be high priority since oil will peak much sooner than natural gas or coal.  I used to be critical of electric vehicles (EVs) and still am to some degree, but I will admit that they are approaching affordability.  If battery storage can continue to improve, I think they may become viable replacements for internal combustion engine (ICE) cars without subsidies.

- Related to the previous, I think the densest urban areas really ought to implement [SkyTran](http://www.skytran.net/) or something like it.  Tel Aviv, Israel is building a test section.  Some places in the U.S. have considered it, but haven't yet committed.

- I think current-level nuclear technology should be replacing retiring coal plants.  Natural gas plants are cheap to build and quite efficient when run in a combined cycle configuration, but I think fuel costs for those plants can only go up.  We still have very cheap natural gas because of all the money that was invested in exploration and production over the last decade.  That money has largely dried up, though, so natural gas plants won't have the cost advantage forever.

- I think we really need to devote some resourced to exploring advanced nuclear options.  The Chinese Academy of Sciences has dusted off the work the U.S. did at Oak Ridge National labs 50 years ago and now has 400 scientists working on building two test Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors (LFTRs) by 2020.  (LFTRs are a type of Molten Salt Reactor, or MSR, if you run into that term elsewhere.)  They expect to have commercial reactors rolling off the line within a decade after their test reactors come online.  There are some other approaches to advanced nuclear as well, some of them fusion, that might be worth considering.

- Large transportation ships should be allowed to have small nuclear reactors onboard.  Currently only military ships (and one Russian icebreaker that I'm aware of) are nuclear.  With some forethought, I think we could put sufficient safety protocols in place to allow for civilian ships to have nuclear reactors as well.

- A good many environmentalists and peak oilers support many of my suggestions, but think the process should be goosed along by international treaties and carbon taxes.  In my opinion, neither are good ideas, nor likely to be widely adopted.  The former always break down into issues of reparations with developing nations demanding money from developed nations and developed nations not-so-subtly bringing up aid programs.  The latter (a carbon tax) is extremely regressive.  I've heard people say that the tax revenue would be simply be redistributed, but there are lots of problems with that idea, too.

- Finally, I think we have a duty to help developing nations develop.  I have yet to see any evidence that a nation can develop without massively increasing its energy consumption, so I think we need to stop telling poorer countries that their only energy options are wind and solar.  They need the cheapest energy they can get.  I think we can get nuclear cheap enough and safe enough to do the job, but I don't think we should block financing for coal or natural gas plants at the present time.

I know there are a few items that have slipped my mind because it's getting late and I'm forgetful even when well rested, but I think you get the shape of what I recommend.  I have considered the questions of nuclear waste and sufficient nuclear fuel sources and the other issues people bring up when I talk about nuclear power, so I can address those if you see those as hang-ups to my recommendations, but I think I've gone deep enough for tonight.

Yes, there are.  Let's break this down a little.

&gt;Something like 97% of climate scientists agree that Anthropogenic climate change is taking place.

It's not a binary proposition.  Yes, 97% of climate scientists of a certain group said that CO2 is a greenhouse gas and that mankind emits a lot of CO2; therefore, mankind has an impact on climate.  The problem is that most climate skeptics also agree with that statement.

What you are missing is that there a a huge range of opinion within that context.  The amount of total warming expected from human activity is all over the place.  AR5, the latest IPCC report, has a likely range of ECS from 1.5°C per doubling of atmospheric CO2 to 4.5°C per doubling.  That's a factor of three.  That range actually increased from AR4.  Not only that, there is a huge range of opinion on how much CO2 mankind can emit because of fossil fuel supply constraints.  So you have an uncertainty within an uncertainty.

When people like yourself try to frame the issue as binary, and I hope you can take a little criticism here, it shows they really haven't looked at the issue much.  Of course humans contribute to climate change.  That hasn't been debated for a long time.  The big question is how much, and that has been a very tough question to answer.  When you come along and try to frame the issue as scientists of all one opinion on one side and non-scientists on the other, it shows you are pretty new to the discussion.  Sorry to be so blunt.

The reason I created this subreddit in the first place was to move beyond such elementary lamentations.  It's a place to have a serious discussion about the many, many subtopics of climate change.

By framing the issue the way he did, your friend shows real wisdom.  A couple of thoughts to add some further nuance:

- ""A"" is best understood as measurable warming.  There has been effort on the part of some activists to redefine ""A"" to mean *effects* of warming.  That can only obfuscate the issue.

- There is still much debate on #3.  The IPCC's latest report, AR5, suggested more certainly that at least half of the warming post-1950 was due to mankind; however, the same report actually increased the uncertainty of eventual warming give a doubling of CO2.

- ""C"" consists of a whole raft of things.  The big ones are sea level rise and ocean acidification.  The former has the most direct impact on coastal communities.  The latter, some fear, has the biggest effect on ecosystems.  Other effects, like drought for example, have a much, much lower LOSU (level of scientific understanding) so should be listed under a ""possible"" heading.

- In addition to #5 (mitigation), there is now much discussion on the cost/benefit of adaptation rather then mitigation.  AR5 WGII suggested adaption would be cheaper than previously thought, while AR5 WGIII suggested mitigation would be substantially more expensive than previously thought.

- There might be one more major point to add somewhere between #3 and #4.  There is a very wide range of scientific opinion on the *rate* of A; therefore, C is fully dependent in scale on what the *rate* of A turns out to be.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_25gms7",1400001669,2014-05-13 17:21:09,"Will_Power"

Here are the relevant portions from nationalgeographic.com:

&gt;The glaciers contain enough ice to raise global sea level by **4 feet** (1.2 meters) and are melting faster than most scientists had expected, which will require adjusting estimates of sea-level rise, said Rignot, who is also a glaciologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
&gt;
&gt;At their current rates of melting, he said, these glaciers would disappear in about **two centuries**, though ""it could proceed faster or slower.""
&gt;...
&gt;**If** the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet did melt, sea level would rise 11 feet (3.3 meters), according to previous research.

From nytimes.com:

&gt;**If** the findings hold up, they suggest that the melting **could** destabilize neighboring parts of the ice sheet and a rise in sea level of 10 feet or more **may** be unavoidable in coming centuries.
&gt;...
&gt;Those six glaciers alone **could** cause the ocean to rise **four feet** as they disappear, Dr. Rignot said, **possibly within a couple of centuries.** 

Now compare that to the headline.  Is the conclusion in the headline justified based on the sources?  I don't think so.

When you read the actual documents, they bribed FDA, tainted the science to get drugs approved. Paid doctors to push them and even on conditions they were not fraudulently approved for.

There is your absolute science. As long as men/humans are involved in science it will remain just as corrupt as religion. Don't throw stones when you live in a glass house.

Life is a series of decisions, you can say it's based on science, but most of the time it's not when politics creep into the field.

You are obviously young, so a word to the wise...Question Everything, even your own science.

That's why I came here, to gather information and educate myself.

While I believe there is global warming now, I don't think it is as bad as most think and we have peaked with fossil fuels. If we are past the peak of the oil era, what is the big rush in taxing the global populations if we will be out in 40 years? 0.75 is all of the current increase in temps.

Just because it is happening does not mean the sky is falling at the speed of light. 

I have much left to study before making my ""decision"" on what we should do about it...if anything since we are running out of fossil fuels.

"558","chksy52","1","0","t1_chks5zz","**Safety:**

Not to minimize the Fukushima disaster, but the amount of radiation that leaked from it is equivalent to about 76 million [banana equivalent doses].  The disastrous tsunami killed something like 20,000 people, but the Fukushima reactor hasn't actually been linked to a single death yet.  Keep in mind that it was a 40 year old reactor, still operating well past its expected date.  What's more, the hydrogen explosion was entirely preventable had people followed protocol and shut everything down in order.

That's not to say there aren't risks, it's just that people are weird when it comes to risk assessment.  For example, a great many people avoid flying because when a plane goes down, lots of people die all at once.  Yet, per mile, it's the safest form of transportation we have.  Nuclear is similar.  It has the lowest fatalities per TWh produced, lower even than solar, yet people see Fukushima and their emotional response kicks in and overrides their ability to reason.

Incidentally, we've been talking exclusively about nuclear reactors designed in the 1950s.  Imagine trying to have this conversation via 1950's era computers.  Nuclear has advanced a great deal since then, and many of the newer designs (like the LFTR that the Chinese Academy of Sciences is working on) are walk away safe.  They can literally go into a safe state by turning off a fan that cools a freeze plug, and if the reaction gets too hot, the same freeze plug melts and the liquid fluoride-thorium salt drains into a storage tanks, stopping any further reactions.  I won't go into too much depth in this comment, but that is just one of many new nuclear designs, and the benefits are astounding.

There are those who hypothesize some sort of terrorist attack on nuclear reactors.  One person, someone I respect, said something to the effect of ""Had the planes on 9/11 hit Indian Point instead of the WTC, NYC would have become uninhabitable.""  As much as I like the guy, he's simply wrong.  Even supposing a breach of the containment building and the reactor itself, and pretending that the safety systems didn't drop the graphite rods that halt reaction, the fuel pellets in the rods, which are ceramic, would have been dispersed for perhaps and acre or two and the dispersion would have ceased all nuclear reaction.  A couple of guys in safety suits with geiger counters would have had them all picked up by the end of the day.

**Subsidies:**

It is true that nuclear power is subsidized by the government, mostly because they wanted a source of plutonium for their nuclear warheads and plutonium is a by-product of uranium in a light-water reactor.  Of course *every* energy source is subsidized in one way or another.  It turns out that the subsidy per kWh produced is much, *much* lower for nuclear than for any form of renewable energy, except perhaps hydro.  Per unit of energy produced, fossil fuels are probably the least subsidized, but there are indeed subsidies for those too.

**Hydrogen:**

Hydrogen doesn't occur naturally on earth, except as part of other molecules.  It's a storage medium.  We get hydrogen by either electrolyzing water (which is very inefficient) or by heating up natural gas (also very inefficient).  So when you see people running cars or melting sand or cutting metal with hydrogen, just recognize that it took more energy to do those things than they would have used had they used electricity or natural gas directly.

**Solar and wind:**

Solar and wind are great, for certain locations and for certain uses.  Their biggest problems are intermittency.  Solar PV produces power for 1/4th of the day, solar thermal for 1/3rd of the day, and wind for 20-30% of the day, but much less predictably.  They simply can't be compared with sources that can produce 24 hours per day, seven days per week unless you want to factor in some sort of storage system, and those are far more expensive than the solar or wind generation by themselves.

Personally, I think nuclear for baseload and solar for peaking load (in the right locations) is a match made in heaven.  Of course, if we see EVs really take off, it will make the most sense to charge them at home at night, so the baseload portion will increase.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_252j6u",1400388448,2014-05-18 04:47:28,"Will_Power"

"590","chmohay","1","0","t1_chmertj","It isn't just semantics.  The implications are profound.  Consider [this graph](http://woodfortrees.org/plot/hadcrut3gl/plot/hadcrut3gl/from:1915/to:1945/trend/plot/hadcrut3gl/from:1975/to:2005/trend).  I've marked on there the two warming periods of the last century: 1915-1945 and 1975-2005.  

You'll note that the rate of warming of each is roughly the same, but most climate scientists say that forcing from CO2 during the former period wasn't very large, so they attribute most of that  warming period to natural forcings, primarily the sun. You'll note as well that during the period of rapid increase in CO2 (post-WWII) global temperatures actually declined a bit.  The old school of thought was that the cooling was caused by increases in SO2 emissions (a reflective aerosol) that accompanied CO2 emissions.  Unfortunately, we have no good data on airborne aerosols from that period, so that hypothesis couldn't be tested.

In recent years, there has been more and more research on warming/cooling cycles of the ocean.  You'll see terms like PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and AMO (Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation) thrown around.  These cycles are pretty well established in the literature now, and they do affect surface temperatures.  The emerging hypothesis is that the present slow-down in warming and the cooling period from 1945-1975 are due to the cool phase of the PDO, whereas the warming periods of 1915-1945 and 1975-2005 were augmented by the warm phase of the PDO.  

With that understanding, does it make sense to say that 100% of warming was due to mankind?  Does it make sense to say that projecting temperatures forward from the 1975-2005 period is ill-advised?  Hopefully you can see why this isn't just semantics.

I wrote the following three years ago in another subreddit:


1.  **Call out rich hypocrites.**  The skeptics shouldn't have to do this for you.  It should be your responsibility to tell people like James Cameron and Al Gore that they are hurting your cause by adopting a ""do as I say, not as I do"" approach to life.

2.  **Drop carbon trading as a solution.**  It is plain to most that carbon trading schemes are ineffective and easily abused.  The efforts at carbon trading to date are all corrupt.  If you want people to believe that climate change is about anything other than bilking the masses out of money, carbon trading needs to be taken off the table immediately.

3.  **Climate tribunals make your movement look insane.**  It is my understanding that this idea was discussed in Cancun, but I don't have a source that says so.  I do know that the idea has been circulating around for the last several months.  Here's what it comes down to.  People and corporations have emitted CO2 in a manner completely legal in their own countries.  There is no international law forbidding it.  To talk of punishing people for breaking no law smacks of despotism.

4.  **Reparations proposals need to be dropped faster than radioactive waste.**  It is easy to laugh and point at skeptics when they talk about climate change alarmism leading to a one-world government, but this concept of reparations lends credence to such a claim.  It is a transfer of wealth, plain and simple.  It is utterly naive to think that a hand out will be spent to mitigate climate change, especially since so many of the countries that would receive such transfers have long records of using foreign aid to better the elite few at the expense of their citizenry.  Moreover, such a proposal is divisive and prevents any sort of binding treaty from moving forward.  Your movement would be much better off to say that these monies should be diverted to direct carbon capture technologies, such as air capture.  If carbon truly is dangerous, then reward the removal of carbon (not technologies that *might* remove it either, but something that produces measurable results).

5.  **Recognize that there are two sides to the weather != climate coin.**  If you are to be consistent with the message that a cold winter doesn't disprove anthropogenic climate change, you must also admit that a warm summer (or a warm year for that matter) doesn't prove it either.

6.  Similar to item number five, **recognize that current weather events are not proof of AGW.**  The prediction is for extreme weather events to happen when temperatures have warmed by several degrees a hundred years from now, not fractions of one degree today.  You make yourself look silly when you claim that a given weather event is from global warming that hasn't happened yet.

7.  **Find the most likely, most detrimental predictions of AGW and stick to those.**  By now we have all seen this lists of the hundreds of things that are supposedly caused by global warming.  The problem with saying that so many things are caused by global warming is that when a few are shown to be from other causes, it casts doubt on all the rest.  Make a good list of things that will cause the most problems, which are well supported by science (which is different than science-related speculation) and then point out that things that aren't on that list aren't likely.  This will give you credibility.

8.  Finally, **create a vision for the future.**  The current message to everyone is one of privation and millions of little tasks, most of which won't do anything to slow CO2 emissions anyway, and on top of that, taxation with the revenues sent directly to other counties.  I don't know who thought such a message was going to go anywhere, but he or she was dead wrong.  Might I suggest you produce a message about changing the world to a place where more people have access to technology, and those who have technology move on to the next level of development, whether that be mag-lev trains or something else.

Since I wrote that three years ago, I'm sorry to say that those most concerned with climate change have continued to make the same mistakes over and over.  Interest in climate change has been in steady decline since 2007.  People just got sick and tired of hearing the same doom and gloom over and over again.  Do you want to really get people involved in taking active measures to reduce CO2 emissions?  Do you?  Don't talk about Antarctic ice shelves.  Don't talk about weather stripping.  For the love of god, don't talk about how oil companies are funding climate change denial.  People have heard all that hundreds of times.  You have to create a vision for them.  Build a story where nuclear power and some renewables bring the poor into the modern world and give them enough to eat.  Create a narrative where there isn't road construction and traffic jams, but SkyTran or some other transportation scheme.  And don't make the mistake of saying that renewables are the sole answer and nuclear must never be used.  People see right through that sort of ideology and write you off as a shill or ideologue.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_252j6u",1400791041,2014-05-22 20:37:21,"Will_Power"

I'm glad to hear it, sincerely, because many climate activists seem determined to do all they can to turn people off to their message.  I'm just sick of the screaming matches.

&gt;I think one of the biggest concerns is educating the larger population of the necessity for action.

Roger Pielke, Jr. wrote an interesting essay a year or so ago about that very thing.  He pointed to polls in various countries showing that the majority of people actually wanted action on climate change.  As I've said before, the public was all for it in 2007 and 2008.  I don't mean to wreck your enthusiasm, but perhaps you might consider that the lack of action isn't due to needing more public awareness.  I think the solutions that were proffered simply weren't doable.  You see, there are lots of ways to act on climate change, but a very vocal group of activists demanded that the only solutions funded were renewables, mostly solar and wind, and we knew from our work in the 1970s that putting all of our eggs in those baskets was a recipe for failure.

&gt;I also think climate activists need to organize better.

There's no doubt about it.  At present, there is no one to restrain loons like Joe Romm or John Cook's little group.  They make activists look like petty, whiny zealots.

&gt;I believe those who are passionate about the issue should be boycotting the Koch Bros. products. 

In my opinion, that would be a supreme waste of time and resources.  They sell a commodity (coal, not oil).  You can't boycott commodity resources.  That's like saying you would boycott a certain wheat grower.  Someone else will buy the product if you don't.

What I would suggest instead is first focussing your efforts on the only thing that can reasonably displace coal production: nuclear power.  If you want to hurt coal producers like the Koch brothers, there needs to be an alternative to their product.  Solar is great for assisting with peak load in some locations, but neither it nor wind are suitable for baseload generation.  There is a division among the climate activists about nuclear power.  So long as you have a house divided on this issue, you will see no progress.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_252j6u",1401219563,2014-05-27 19:39:23,"Will_Power"

The question you should ask is whether that will be the best use of your activism.  If you think it is, then by all means, boycott.

&gt;China seems to be thinking about real changes these days.

China is still building more coal plants than anyone else, but they are at least also building more nuclear plants than anyone else too.  They've committed to advanced nuclear research and are doing some renewable stuff too.

&gt;I was mostly talking about the US who needs to be educated because of the assault from the right wing media on the issue here.

I think you are making the mistake of assuming that everyone must agree on everything before there is action.  Think of it this way.  Are there people from the right wing who are concerned about the health effects from coal?  If so, can you build bridges and work with those folks on phasing out coal?  Are there people on the right who are concerned that the U.S. still imports 8 million bbl/day of oil and are troubled by the economic and national security aspects of that?  If so, can you find common cause to reduce oil use for those reasons?

&gt;what do you think of this solar roadways thing?

I've been following the solar roadways thing for quite a while, though I noticed more media coverage of late.  It's a great idea, with many advantages if it can be done cost effectively.  City and suburb streets and freeways near cities would be the best locations because there are fewer transmission losses.  If we could get an induction system with fast switching working, we could actually use such road for very light electrical vehicles, which would change everything since they wouldn't need batteries at all on sunny days.  (Of course they would need some battery, but solar roads could extend their range.)","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_252j6u",1401229561,2014-05-27 22:26:01,"Will_Power"

&gt;“I have a problem with the widespread implication (in the popular press) that the West Antarctic collapse can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change,” said Mike Wolovik, a graduate researcher at Lamont-Doherty who studies ice sheet dynamics. “The marine ice sheet instability is an inherent part of ice sheet dynamics that doesn’t require any human forcing to operate. When the papers say that collapse is underway, and likely to last for several hundred years, that’s a reasonable and plausible conclusion.”

&gt;But, he said, the link between CO2 levels and the loss of ice in West Antarctica “is pretty tenuous.” The upwelling of warmer waters that melt the ice has been tied to stronger westerly winds around Antarctica, which have been linked to a stronger air pressure difference between the polar latitudes and the mid-latitudes, which have in turn been linked to global warming.

&gt;“I’m not an atmospheric scientist, so I can’t evaluate the strength of all of those linkages,” Wolovik said. “However, it’s a lot of linkages.” And that leaves a lot of room for uncertainty about what’s actually causing the collapse of the glaciers, he said.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_26153k",1401286847,2014-05-28 14:20:47,"Praetor80"

What you really need to ask yourself is what sorts of return would Norway get on investment should they direct their research money away from finding and developing oil fields and toward ""green"" energy.

Case 1: Solar.  Germany is even having a hard time making profits with its solar businesses.  Several went bankrupt when China entered the market, and many of the bankrupt German firms were bought by Chinese firms. 

Case 2: Wind.  There's lots of competition in Europe already on this, again from Germany.  The intermittency of wind is already making Germany *pay* other countries to take their surplus power on windy days.

Case 3: Wave or ocean current power.  There's been some work on this, but I'm not aware of any major deployments.  Probably growth potential there, but it would be risky and without revenue for several years while developed.

Case 4: Nuclear.  If memory serves, about half of Norway's electricity comes from nuclear power, so there must be nuclear expertise in the country.  You might be able to leverage these expertise into an export business the way South Korea and the U.S. have.

The problem with each of these is that they don't produce liquid transportation fuel.  Biofuels have mostly been flops in countries where they have been tried, with notable exceptions like Brazil where the local climate allows sugar cane to grow.

What specifically?  AR4 had a likely range of ECS of 2-4.5°C, with a distribution skewed right, meaning that the higher end was less likely than the lower end.  AR5 had to lower the bottom end of that range to 1.5°C because of several papers based on observations.

Several papers of late have lowered TCR from ~1.8°C to ~1.3°C.

Combine that with several lines of evidence suggesting economically recoverable fossil fuel reserves are significantly smaller than total reserves, and you have some decent constraints on expected warming this century.  Here are some sources on fossil fuel constraints:

Here are a few responses to your posts
&gt;Things that make me very skeptic:
since the 1950s we keep hearing sensationalist stuff on how oil is ending ""really soon now"" - but in the end geologists have pushed that much, much further away than initially estimated, so this could also be equally wrong on coal;
no serious talk about shale oil - that alone can double or triple the amount of fossil-fuel and related CO2;
a carbon cycle that seems to be at odds with anything else in published science; most of all - something that magically is fixing all our problems without any real effort from us - if somebody could add an afterlife to that story they can start a good religion based on it!

You never reply to this. What about artificially created oil?

&gt;A real literature review does not end when you find the a handful of papers the affirm your pre-conceived notion.


Really it seems like the crux of your theory is that at some point we will run out of economically viably extractable fossil fuel/coal based resources. Let me ask you, what will happen to societies based on those resources? Will they leave resources in the ground when the prices of those fuels rise or will they try to create technologies, possibly more destructive technologies, to collect them?

I'm sure they think the alarmism aspect *is* a hoax.  What you haven't shown is that they claim there is no climate change and that mankind had no influence on climate, which are the criteria we discussed.

&gt;If you didn't actually take the time to follow the research I provided for you, what makes you think I will respect the links you send? 

Because mine were mostly peer-reviewed papers, not quote-mined media sources.

&gt;Have you researched the Heartland Institute?

Yes.  I know around 5-10% of their budget goes toward climate related things, like the upcoming conference.  I know they are funded by conservatives included one or both of the Koch brothers.  I know they have a strong bias, just as you do.

&gt;You never reply to this. 

I don't recall seeing that.  Can you provide a link?  I may have overlooked it.  The meat of the comment is that peak oil was predicted a long time ago and it hasn't happened yet, so it will never happen.  Do you see the logical error with that?  By the way, conventional crude peaked in 2005 or 2006, according to the IEA, so predictions of peak oil were really quite close.  (M. King Hubbert said conventional crude would peak in the year 2000, clear back in the 1950s.)

&gt;What about artificially created oil?

What about it?  Where do you get the energy do create it?  If you are talking about biofuels, look at the corn ethanol debacle.  The net carbon savings from that are very near zero, once fossil fuel inputs into all the required processes are considered.  What's worse, is the monoculture of corn is wreaking havoc on local ecosystems, not to mention the effects this is all having on global food prices.

A better way to produce liquid fuels is via processes akin to the Fischer-Tropsch process, but that too requires huge energy inputs.  That means you are essentially converting coal and natural gas to liquid fuel, but very inefficiently.  It's much better to just use the natural gas directly.  The best way to synthesize liquid fuels via F-T is to use high-temperature nuclear reactors that are still on the drawing table for the most part.  (Oak Ridge National Labs did run two test reactors of this type for thousands of hours, but the Nixon Administration pulled the plug on them to fund a different reactor type in his home state of California.)

&gt;Really it seems like the crux of your theory is that at some point we will run out of economically viably extractable fossil fuel/coal based resources. 

That's half of the argument.  The other half is that the newest observationally based estimates of ECS are significantly lower than those produced by GCMs.

&gt;Let me ask you, what will happen to societies based on those resources?

Those nations that are net fossil fuel importers will have a really bad time.  Fossil fuel exporters will continue to be rich until their internal consumption grows to the point of making them net importers.

&gt;Will they leave resources in the ground when the prices of those fuels rise or will they try to create technologies, possibly more destructive technologies, to collect them?

You seem to have a world view that everyone is just sitting around with their thumbs up their butts pretending fossil fuels are infinite resources.  They are not.  Lots of countries are working very hard on alternatives.  Unfortunately, the biggest obstacles to development of advanced nuclear energy, the technology that could do more to displace fossil fuel use than any other alternative energy, are environmental groups themselves.  The Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, and Greenpeace are all official opposed to nuclear power; this despite the fact that most environmentalists support nuclear as a very low-carbon path into the future, and more are adopting that viewpoint all the time.  If you really want to put your journalistic activism to good use, expose the hypocrisy of those organizations.

&gt;Would you be against actions to try and curb our use of these resources before we reach ""peak?""

Absolutely.  I've said so for a long time.  Sadly, it is those who cry ""Global Warming!"" one day and ""No more Nukes!"" the next that are really inhibiting our ability to move beyond fossil fuels.  A few weeks back someone in this subreddit asked how I think we should proceed.  Allow me to copy/paste a portion of that answer hear, in bullet point form:


- While solar and wind are great for certain places at certain times, I do not believe they should be *the* general prescription for our energy needs.  Even very concerned climate scientists like Jim Hansen and Kerry Emanuel [agree on this point](http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists-letter/).  Solar is great for hot, sunny places like Phoenix.  I think everyone there should consider rooftop solar, especially businesses.  I think there are places where wind makes sense too; however, both solar and wind are diffuse and intermittent.  They are simply not suitable replacements for coal- or gas-generated electricity.  

- We would do well to electrify transportation as much as possible, but recognize that this will probably take a couple of decades.  I think this should be high priority since oil will peak much sooner than natural gas or coal.  I used to be critical of electric vehicles (EVs) and still am to some degree, but I will admit that they are approaching affordability.  If battery storage can continue to improve, I think they may become viable replacements for internal combustion engine (ICE) cars without subsidies.

- Related to the previous, I think the densest urban areas really ought to implement [SkyTran](http://www.skytran.net/) or something like it.  Tel Aviv, Israel is building a test section.  Some places in the U.S. have considered it, but haven't yet committed.

- I think current-level nuclear technology should be replacing retiring coal plants.  Natural gas plants are cheap to build and quite efficient when run in a combined cycle configuration, but I think fuel costs for those plants can only go up.  We still have very cheap natural gas because of all the money that was invested in exploration and production over the last decade.  That money has largely dried up, though, so natural gas plants won't have the cost advantage forever.

- I think we really need to devote some resourced to exploring advanced nuclear options.  The Chinese Academy of Sciences has dusted off the work the U.S. did at Oak Ridge National labs 50 years ago and now has 400 scientists working on building two test Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors (LFTRs) by 2020.  (LFTRs are a type of Molten Salt Reactor, or MSR, if you run into that term elsewhere.)  They expect to have commercial reactors rolling off the line within a decade after their test reactors come online.  There are some other approaches to advanced nuclear as well, some of them fusion, that might be worth considering.

- Large transportation ships should be allowed to have small nuclear reactors onboard.  Currently only military ships (and one Russian icebreaker that I'm aware of) are nuclear.  With some forethought, I think we could put sufficient safety protocols in place to allow for civilian ships to have nuclear reactors as well.

- A good many environmentalists and peak oilers support many of my suggestions, but think the process should be goosed along by international treaties and carbon taxes.  In my opinion, neither are good ideas, nor likely to be widely adopted.  The former always break down into issues of reparations with developing nations demanding money from developed nations and developed nations not-so-subtly bringing up aid programs.  The latter (a carbon tax) is extremely regressive.  I've heard people say that the tax revenue would be simply be redistributed, but there are lots of problems with that idea, too.

- Finally, I think we have a duty to help developing nations develop.  I have yet to see any evidence that a nation can develop without massively increasing its energy consumption, so I think we need to stop telling poorer countries that their only energy options are wind and solar.  They need the cheapest energy they can get.  I think we can get nuclear cheap enough and safe enough to do the job, but I don't think we should block financing for coal or natural gas plants at the present time.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_27bzfd",1402074845,2014-06-06 17:14:05,"Will_Power"

Are you the type of journalist that doesn't bother with what people actually say?

&gt;...but those few have HUGE influence over politics, money and our lives.

Then you are starting with a bad assumption and trying to bolster it.  The lack of action, as you see it, on reducing CO2 emissions isn't from this little group.  It's because:

a) retooling an energy infrastructure is incredibly expensive, and is being demanded at a time of economic weakness.

b) simply making energy more expensive in order to reduce use has drastic economic consequences, especially on the poorest who pay the highest percentages of their household income on energy.

c) climate activists opposing nuclear power.

d) not having a good substitute for liquid transportation fuels.

e) solar and wind are intermittent and don't produce baseload power.

f) natural gas is currently cheap.

g) there is no good grid-level storage technology to deal with intermittency.

It's simple laziness to try to ignore all those factors and lay it all on the fringe of the conversation.

&gt;I am one of the Eco people that think that nuclear is an option, though currently not a safe one.

In sixty years of civilian nuclear operations, nuclear power has the lowest number of fatalities per watt-hour produced, even lower than solar or wind.  Why is it not currently safe?  Why are people such as yourself not dealing with the much bigger obstacle to change (anti-nuclear political groups) instead of focusing on the fringe nut-jobs?

I don't know if you read my longer comment, but I urge you to do so if you haven't in full.  There is likely much to agree on.

Now, I know we started off rough.  You have identified what you see as *the* problem and want to go off to Vegas to fight what you see as *the* enemy.  I know you don't want to hear from people like me who are saying that there are bigger enemies to real change.  It's far less fun to stand up to people like yourself with generally similar ideals and say, ""Friend, *you* are the problem.""  I'm sorry to be the one suggesting you might have it wrong.  It really isn't fun for me to bear bad news.  I simply think you could have a lot more success if you quit fanning the flames and worked to change minds about the source of power that had done more to offset carbon emissions since its inception and has the potential to offset the most into the future.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_27bzfd",1402076535,2014-06-06 17:42:15,"Will_Power"

&gt;a) retooling an energy infrastructure is incredibly expensive, and is being demanded at a time of economic weakness.

The costs of creating and pushing a new industry will be outweighed by the development of a new industry. This is how the market works. The old way is one of the reason that we are in the economic downturn we are in - our reliance on oil that continues to grow in cost, both in dollars and in neighborhood costs. 

&gt;b) simply making energy more expensive in order to reduce use has drastic economic consequences, especially on the poorest who pay the highest percentages of their household income on energy.

The LEAST we could do remove the billions in subsidies the industry currently gets into alternatives like geo thermal and biomass.

&gt;c) climate activists opposing nuclear power.

That is going to be an uphill battle on the backs of the various disasters that have been out there. You say - ""In sixty years of civilian nuclear operations, nuclear power has the lowest number of fatalities per watt-hour produced, even lower than solar or wind."" Can you cite that?

&gt;d) not having a good substitute for liquid transportation fuels.

This is also partially because of the oil industry pushing against public trans and alternative trans. Don't believe me? Just google it. 

&gt;e) solar and wind are intermittent and don't produce baseload power.

That is ignoring other methods like geothermal, biomass and a few others. The thing is that we are still thinking in the current grid mentality. I envision a world grid made up of interconnecting micro grids with household/building production with micro solar and micro turbine yet connected to every location that receives sun and wind. 

&gt;f) natural gas is currently cheap.

For now, but it hasn't included the neighborhood costs and the other externalities that come with retrieving and using the product. 

&gt;g) there is no good grid-level storage technology to deal with intermittency.

Tesla and many other companies are currently working on this. There CURRENTLY isn't an awesome solution but I like it better than oil and gas.

I'm not.  I'm saying they aren't the only reason there's no action.  I'm also saying quite clearly that the biggest obstacle to GHG reduction is **not** them, but the anti-nuclear green groups I've named.

&gt;The costs of creating and pushing a new industry will be outweighed by the development of a new industry.

No, that's the broken window fallacy.  Look at Germany or Spain as an example.  Tons of money was poured into solar development, then China came along and beat them on price for solar PV.  Several German solar firms went bankrupt, only to be bough out by Chinese firms, and the whole country of Spain is near bankruptcy.  Germany has weathered that storm because they are an exporter of other goods (BMW, VW, Sieman's, etc.), but their investment in new energy in the end transferred to China.

&gt;The old way is one of the reason that we are in the economic downturn we are in - our reliance on oil that continues to grow in cost, both in dollars and in neighborhood costs.

I agree.  All but one of the post WWII recessions was immediately preceded by an oil price shock.  Unfortunately, what I hear from climate activists is that we need solar and wind.  Neither solar nor wind produce liquid transportation fuel, so the policy recommendations do nothing for the oil problem.

&gt;The LEAST we could do remove the billions in subsidies the industry currently gets...

[Here](https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/012813.pdf) [pdf] is the IMF's report on energy subsides.  Take particular note of figures 3 and 4.  The U.S. is part of the ""advanced"" category.  Surprising how little the subsidies are, isn't it?  I know I was surprised when I first found it.

In the U.S., energy supports are generally of four forms:

- HEAT and similar programs for the poor.

- Tax-free fuel for farmers.

- Strategic Petroleum Reserve purchases.

- Corporate tax breaks.

I oppose elimination of the first two, because I think poor families need the help and increased food prices hurt everyone, especially the poor.

The third isn't really a subsidy because SPR isn't growing, and it fact has been used to help stabilize oil prices when the market gets jittery.

I'm all for removing corporate tax breaks because it is a corrupting influence in Washington.  I think the corporate income tax should be the same for all companies.  

&gt;... into alternatives like geo thermal and biomass.

Geothermal is incredibly expensive and itself has required extensive subsidies to exist.  It is really only appropriate for certain sites as well.  We've discussed the problems with biomass (food prices go up, eco-system damage, loss of topsoil).  The primary contribute at /r/biochar and I have discussed this at length.  We still disagree, but the right crops *might* be suitable for further research.  Why not earmark these funds for new nuclear plants?

Consider your statement, though.  Why are we talking about the ""LEAST"" we can do?  We are talking about big changes.  We should be talking about the best ways to get the most CO2 reduction for our efforts, should we not?

&gt;That is going to be an uphill battle on the backs of the various disasters that have been out there.

Do you ever fly commercial air?  (Can you see where I'm going with this?)

&gt;Can you cite that?

[Here you go.](http://nextbigfuture.com/2008/03/deaths-per-twh-for-all-energy-sources.html)  (Don't let the ugliness of that page fool you; the article is well sourced.)

&gt;This is also partially because of the oil industry pushing against public trans and alternative trans.

I don't doubt it.  At the same time, EVs are coming along and the oil companies haven't been able to slow that much.  

&gt;That is ignoring other methods like geothermal, biomass and a few others.

Geothermal is great if there is a good site, though it is much more expensive than other sources.  Biomass we've discussed.  Biomass works really well in countries like Brazil where they can grow sugar cane.  The distill the sugar into ethanol and burn the waste stocks to power the distilleries.  Still, it's not much of a baseload solution.  The biggest obstacle to biomass is that plant matter simply doesn't utilize that much solar energy.  The average is around 1% of solar energy hitting a plant becomes biomass.  Even if we covered every last inch of the U.S. with plants for this purpose, it wouldn't be enough to cover our energy needs.  Not even close.  That's to say nothing of the displaced food production, water needs, etc.

&gt;The thing is that we are still thinking in the current grid mentality...

For good reason.  Grid scale power production is more efficient and therefore less polluting.  (Efficiency scales with size for energy from thermal sources.)  It would be lovely if every roof was covered in solar panels and there were batteries to catch and release the surplus.  Sadly, the obstacle to that is storage.  Storage is still incredibly expensive and not getting cheaper very quickly at all.

&gt;For now...

Right.  We had a glut after the huge investment in oil exploration post 2008.  It *will* go back up because the exploration budgets have gone way, way down.

&gt;Tesla and many other companies are currently working on this.

Tesla and other car companies are working on batteries that are as light as possible for mobile purposes.  For static purposes, the cheapest batteries are *still* lead-acid, a technology more than 100 years old.  Hard to believe isn't it?  There are companies working on grid-scale storage with massive ""flow"" batteries or liquid metal batteries, but none of them are commercial yet.  There are tons of ways to store energy (flywheels, pumped hydro, compressed air, etc.), but none of them are cheap enough to allow for grid-parity on a 24/7 comparison.  Not even close.

&gt;I don't think that those who are trying to create a new approach to energy and our environment are the problem

If they oppose nuclear power, they really are.  Harsh, I know, but it's true.

&gt;I think that those who use their money and influence to obfuscate the issue and keep us in a terrible position are the problem.

I know you think that.  I'm trying to get you to really examine that assumption.

"673","cico51m","1","0","t3_28nril","Climate change and science in general only make up part of the essay, so perhaps John won't mind if I quote the relevant paragraphs:

&gt;That said, there were a few jarring moments, and one of them happened in the interval between my talk on dark ages and Dr. Mark Cochrane’s excellent presentation on the realities of climate change. In the Q&amp;A session after my talk, in response to a question from the audience, *I noted how the prestige of science among the general public had taken a beating due to the way that scientific opinions handed down to the public as proven fact so often get retracted after a decade or so, a habit that has caused  many people outside the scientific community to treat all scientific pronouncements with skepticism.* I cited several examples of this, *and one of them was the way that popular works on climate science in the 1970s and 1980s routinely claimed that the world was on the brink of a new ice age.*
&gt;
&gt;Mention the existence of those claims nowadays and you’ll inevitably get denounced as a climate denialist. As my regular readers know, I’m nothing of the kind; I’ve written extensively about the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on the decades and centuries ahead, and my recently published science fiction novel Star’s Reach takes place in a 25th-century America ravaged by the impacts of climate change, in which oranges are grown in what’s now Illinois and Memphis has become a seaport. *It’s become popular, for that matter, to insist that those claims of a new ice age never happened; I’d be happy, if anyone’s curious, to cite books published in the 1970s and 1980s for the general public, written by eminent scientists and respected science writers, that described the imminent ice age as a scientifically proven fact, since I have several on my bookshelf.*
&gt;
&gt;What I found interesting is that Dr. Cochrane, who is a more than usually careful scholar, jumped to the conclusion that my reference to these popular works of a bygone decade meant that I must be a climate denialist. I corrected him, and he accepted the correction gracefully.  Yet permaculturist and peak oil author Albert Bates then proceeded to miss my point in exactly the same way in his blog post on the event. Bates was present at the discussion, and presumably heard the whole exchange. He’s neither a stupid man nor a malicious one; why, then, so embarrassing and so public a misstatement?
&gt;
&gt;This isn't a rhetorical question, either; it has an answer, and the answer follows from another of the most popular stories of our culture, the story that says that having the right answer is all you need to get people to listen to you. You’ll find narratives with that theme straight through the popular culture of the last two centuries and more, and it also pervades the rhetoric of science and of scientific history: once the protagonist figures out what’s really going on, whether it’s a murder mystery or the hunt for the molecular structure of DNA, everything falls promptly into place.
&gt;
&gt;Now of course in the real world, things aren’t generally so easy. That was precisely the point I was trying to make in the discussion at the Age of Limits conference: *however convincing the evidence for anthropogenic climate change may be to scientists, it’s failed to convince a great many people outside the scientific enterprise, and one of the things that’s driven that failure is the accelerating decline in the prestige of science in modern industrial society as a whole. Among the roots of that decline, in turn, is the dogmatic tone so often taken when scientists and science writers set out to communicate current scientific opinions to the general public—a tone that differs sharply, it bears remembering, from the far more tentative habits of communication practiced within the scientific community itself.*
&gt;
&gt;When climate scientists today insist that they’ve determined conclusively that we’ve entered an age of rising temperatures, I see no reason to doubt them—but they need to recall that many people still remember when writers and speakers with equally impressive scientific credentials insisted with equal vigor that it was just as certain that we’d entered an age of cooling temperatures.  Scientists in the relevant fields know what’s behind the change, but people outside the scientific community don’t; all they see is a flip-flop, and since such flip-flops of scientific opinion have been fairly common in recent decades, members of the general public are by no means as quick as they once were to take scientists at their word. *For that matter, when spokespeople for the scientific community insist to the general public nowadays that the flip-flop never took place—that, for example, no reputable scientist or science writer ever claimed to the general public that a new ice age was imminent—those spokespeople simply leave themselves and the scientific community wide open to accusations of bad faith.*
&gt;
&gt;We don’t talk about the political dimensions of scientific authority in the modern industrial world. That’s what lies behind the convenient and inaccurate narrative I mentioned earlier, the one that claims that all you have to do to convince people is speak the truth. Question that story, and you have to deal with the mixed motives and tangled cultural politics inseparable from science as a human activity, and above all, you have to discuss the much-vexed relationship between the scientific community and a general public that has become increasingly suspicious of the rhetoric of expertise in contemporary life.
&gt;
&gt;That relationship has dimensions that I don’t think anyone in the scientific community these days has quite grasped. I’ve been told privately by several active online proponents of creationism, for example, that they don’t actually care that much about how the world’s current stock of life forms got there; it’s just that the spluttering Donald Duck frenzy that can reliably be elicited from your common or garden variety rationalist atheist by questioning Darwin’s theory is too entertaining to skip.
&gt;
&gt;Such reflections lead in directions most Americans aren’t willing to go, because they can’t be discussed without raising deeply troubling issues about the conflict between the cult of expertise and what’s left of the traditions of American democracy, and about the social construction of what’s considered real in this as in every other human culture. *It’s much easier, and much more comfortable, to insist that the people on the other side of the divide just mentioned are simply stupid and evil, and—as in the example I cited earlier—to force any attempt to talk about the faltering prestige of science in today’s America into a more familiar discourse about who’s right and who’s wrong.*","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_28nril",1403288210,2014-06-20 18:16:50,"Will_Power"

At that time a lot of money and effort went in to keeping track of ice movements in order to make best use of the very limited time that was available for ocean transport of a lot of the necessities of life into the isolated communities in the High arctic.
Some years sea traffic into some settlements was barely possible and it was not unusual for vessels to get stranded up there by the short season.  There was a whole lot of ice and it was a problem.  The ice patrol and other similar programs were discontinued before the end of the 90's.  This was partly due to satellite information coming on line but also because it was just not required any more.  The schedules of the shipping companies didn't have to be altered because all the ports they needed to get to were open during the time frame they were accustomed to use.  That much ice was gone 20 or more years ago.  Now scientific type people have been active around that area for more than 150 years and the Inuit longer, and I can remember people remarking in the late 80's that there had never been so little ice in anyone's memories.  In fact some former settlements were no longer tenable because of rising sea levels.  A little bit of grade school physics can demonstrate that it took a lot of calories to melt this stuff.  This trend, in spite of some false reports to the contrary, has not altered or slowed.  The possibility of an ice free Arctic Ocean, at least in summer is distinct.  Now this ice was sitting on water mostly so it is not that big a deal now.  The problem is the Greenland icecap and other land based ice which will now be subject to heat exchange from liquid water in the vicinity. 

   I remember some years back there was a thunderstorm at the remote community of Sach's Harbour, Nunavut.  There had never been a thunderstorm observed at that site ever.  Not even in the folklore of the indigenous people.  As a final remark some of the comments with that NG article are offensively wrong.

The results of those studies have produced a very different conclusion.

Northern Illimois. It was negative 25 degrees here with a negative 70 wind chill factor. Lake Michigan probably had more ice than the Arctice.  Shit it didn't get warm until mid June here and usually early may is when we have nice weather ( north of Chicago ).  In fact in Manitoba Canada it was one degree colder than it was on the surface of mars this winter. 

Uh no climate and weather are not fucking different. What makes up a climate? WEATHER!

I've got huge, huge issues with inaccuracy in journalism.  Both manufacturing of ""facts"", and of blatently manipulative titles and content.  In general I'm not particularly well disposed to Vice.  It's far too high on the outrage factor, and too low on facts and exposition.

I rail about a number of aspects of [media](/r/dredmorbius/search?q=flair%3A%22Media%22&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on) on my own subreddit, /r/dredmorbius.  One aspect of the Vice piece is that it's what I call a [lie of distraction](/r/dredmorbius/comments/1wc4vn/lies_organic_or_otherwise/).  Even where it's discussing a relevant and significant topic (global warming), it's doing it in a way that ultimately doesn't much increase the level of education or understanding on the topic.  It's [weaponized clickbait](/r/dredmorbius/comments/23twec/weaponized_clickbaits_days_numbered_dont_tease_us/), and an example of [business models shaping content for the worse](/r/dredmorbius/comments/278e2o/the_medium_is_the_message_how_the_technological/).

I can see downvoting the article.  I even support it.  I don't think it merits removal, though I'm wavering on that (and a month in, definitely not).

I'd consider vice.com for a domain ban via automoderator, though.

I'd also strongly suggest you consider link flair for this use -- you can set up flair for ""Misleading"" or ""Recommended"" (or better names, branding's not my strong suit, particularly at this hour of the afternoon).  A few of the news subs do this.

I also use RES to apply tags users who submit crap content to subs so that I'm alerted when they do it again.  (I also tag trolls, shills, and yes, the odd helpful or clueful person, and I must've been drunk some time back as /u/Will_Power has a ""clueful"" tag next to his name up there.)  And if I see continued crap from them, eventually I learn to tune it out (or as moderator I act to curtail privs).

If anyone understands heat and the transference thereof, it is generally anyone alive, but moreso meteorologists. They are not only scientifically trained in understanding climate and looking at past weather patterns to provide future indicators,  they are also prominent students of climate modelling and history. 

So when a renowned meteorologist, one of many, says man made global warming is a hoax, I generally believe them.  

If meteorologists, being masters of climate and data modelling can barely predict future weather patterns more than a few days in advance, then what makes anyone think these global warming scam artists can do it with such accuracy that has never existed before or ever will in all of science?

Food prices have gone up in part because of increased use of food crops for biofuels.  It's a true irony: biofuels are enabled by policy intended to prevent climate change (and resulting wars), and they ended up causing wars via high food prices.

Second, population doesn't just continue to grow.  Consider the [Demographic-economic paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic-economic_paradox).

 [**Demographic-economic paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic-economic%20paradox): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __demographic-economic paradox__ is the inverse [correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation) found between wealth and [fertility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_rate) within and between nations. The higher the degree of [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education) and [GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product) per capita of a human [population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population), subpopulation or [social stratum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratum), the fewer children are born in any industrialized country. In a 1974 UN population conference in Bucharest, [Karan Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Singh), a former minister of population in India, illustrated this trend by stating ""Development is the best contraceptive."" 

&gt;The term ""paradox"" comes from the notion that greater means would necessitate the production of more offspring as suggested by the influential [Thomas Malthus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Malthus).  Roughly speaking, nations or subpopulations with higher [GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product) per capita are observed to have fewer children, even though a richer population can support more children. Malthus held that in order to prevent widespread suffering, from famine for example, what he called ""moral restraint"" (which included [abstinence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence)) was required. The demographic-economic paradox suggests that reproductive restraint arises naturally as a consequence of economic progress.

&gt;It is hypothesized that the observed trend has come about as a response to increased life expectancy, reduced childhood mortality, improved female literacy and independence, and urbanization that all result from increased GDP per capita,  consistent with the [demographic transition model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition).

If I had proposed a 300-400% tax on oil in the year 2000, even most green activists would have taken a few subtle steps away from me.  Yet oil price quadrupled from those prices over the next decade and have stayed high, and consumption has continued to grow.  Why?  Because we have no good alternative.  Despite all of our efforts and literally billions spent on alternatives, all we've managed to do is turn food crops into a little bit of ethanol while driving up food prices worldwide.  (Incidentally, food price spikes spark off riots and the Arab Spring happened right at the peak of the global food price index.)

Energy isn't a luxury good.  It is the lifeblood of modern civilization.  It's what separates this era from all civilizations in the past.  If you make energy more expensive, you *will* see economic declines.  

What's more, it is the poor who pay the most for carbon taxation.  Carbon taxes are widely acknowledged as regressive since poor people pay a higher percent of their income toward energy than do wealthier people.  

Some carbon tax advocates say, ""Well, that's simple.  We'll just redistribute the taxes.""  Of course they fail to mention that carbon tax revenues are already supposed to pay for more renewables, more research, reparations to other nations, etc.  Let's assume though, that not one penny from a carbon tax will go toward anything but redistribution.  Will the fixed-income widow in San Diego get the same rebate as the working parents with the same income in Phoenix who have to commute to work?

Then there is competitive advantage.  Countries that make their energy more expensive via taxation place themselves at a competitive disadvantage compared to nations with cheap, dirty energy.  Do tariff's on goods made in those countries become a requirement of a carbon tax?

What is really needed is an energy source *cheaper* than fossil fuels.  Solar and wind may become cheaper... when they are producing, but they produce for maybe six hours per day, a little more for the best sites, but the best sites were built out first.  Nuclear is still opposed by Greenpeace and other big name NGOs for some reason, so we are left without a solution until they listen to climate scientists like Jim Hansen, Kerry Emanuel, Tom Wigley, and Ken Caldeira and reverse their stance on nuclear.  Even then neither solar, wind, nor nuclear produce liquid fuels on their own.  (We can synthesize liquid transportation fuels given energy input, but that means nuclear as well.)

I think the reason Australia just repealed their carbon tax was because there simply aren't good alternatives to fossil fuels yet.  It is putting the cart before the horse to say that we need to give alternatives energy sources a bit of a temporary price advantage when they simply aren't de facto alternatives yet.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2arlci",1405784270,2014-07-19 15:37:50,"Will_Power"

Then again in 2009:

http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/17/apocalypse-public-climate-change

The public don't want more data.  Hell, they are awash in data all the time.  More data, especially regarding climate, will either be ignored, if it is even perceived, or cause a collective eye roll.

What *is* effective in engaging people in discussions of climate change is positive messaging centering around solutions.  That's a pretty tall order for the segment of activists whose only solution is a tax, so they remain stuck in fear mongering mode.  They simply can't see that they public is meeting that approach with a big, wide yawn.

More recently, the New York Times has noted the problems of communication.  From [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/opinion/global-warming-scare-tactics.html?_r=0):

&gt;If you were looking for ways to increase public skepticism about global warming, you could hardly do better than the forthcoming nine-part series on climate change and natural disasters, starting this Sunday on Showtime.

A little further:

&gt;But there is every reason to believe that efforts to raise public concern about climate change by linking it to natural disasters will backfire. More than a decade’s worth of research suggests that fear-based appeals about climate change inspire denial, fatalism and polarization.

And further still:

&gt;What works, say environmental pollsters and researchers, is focusing on popular solutions. Climate advocates often do this, arguing that solar and wind can reduce emissions while strengthening the economy. But when renewable energy technologies are offered as solutions to the exclusion of other low-carbon alternatives, they polarize rather than unite.
&gt;
&gt;One recent study, published by Yale Law School’s Cultural Cognition Project, found that conservatives become less skeptical about global warming if they first read articles suggesting nuclear energy or geoengineering as solutions.

I disagree that there is any consensus that climate change will result in more poor people than we have at present.  The most commonly cited impact of climate change that would affect large populations is sea level rise, but the rate of rise is so slow that it actually wouldn't displace people in any meaningful way.  I.e., home inundated by rising seas would become so old by the time the water reached them that populations would have moved into newer houses slightly more inland by then.

I also disagree that the welfare of world's poorest billion is much of a priority for many environmentalists, though certainly not all or even most environmentalists.  Suggesting that the worlds poorest should be limited to diffuse, intermittent energy sources like solar and wind is, in my opinion, completely unethical because it places hard limits on the amount of energy available to the world's poorest, and economic growth, despite decades of effort at decoupling, remains a function of energy consumption.

Nevertheless, I completely agree with you that solutions that reduce total global fossil fuel use while simultaneously lifting the world's poorest deserve our greatest effort.  It is my considered opinion that the best way to get there is as follows:

- Advanced nations, and I think China now qualifies for that title and India is getting there, need to generate almost all of their baseload with nuclear power.  Solar and wind have a place, but not for baseload power.  Hydro is great, but I think future hydro plants should be configured to act as quickly dispatchable power instead of baseload.  

- Transportation needs to be electrified as much as possible.  Cities need to focus first on personal rapid transit (PRT) systems like [SkyTran](/r/SkyTran).  There is no reason the big international cargo ships shouldn't be nuclear powered the way aircraft carriers are.  Land based shipping is a tougher nut to crack, but trains are more efficient than trucks and can be electrified easier, so policy needs to encourage more rail transportation.

- Poor nations need to be allowed to burn natural gas, if they have that resource, and even coal of they don't have natural gas.  As they develop, they can move toward the energy configuration of advanced nations.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2bmzif",1406395534,2014-07-26 17:25:34,"Will_Power"

Sure.  Don't try to argue from authority.  If he has training in engineering, talk solutions with him.  Discuss powdering olivine to absorb CO2.  Talk about research into seeding clouds with seawater mist to turn a positive feedback (water vapor) into a negative feedback (low level clouds).  Tell him about how research into seeding the oceans with parts per trillion of iron could result in carbon sequestration to the sea floor while reducing the changes to pH of the ocean.

Like many environmental organizations, CCL is uncomfortably and almost exclusively white (oh, and heterosexual, but that’s for another post.) With CCL’s goal to place a fee or tax on greenhouse gases with proceeds of the collected fee given as a refund to households to help with the inevitable rising energy costs, CCL seems genuinely interested in looking out for the interest of poor and working class people while lobbying for pragmatic energy policy. In hopes of educating its members about the environmental concerns of  people of color, CCL invited Dr. White-Newsome to talk about justice and the environment and the work of WE ACT for Environmental Justice, the organization based in Harlem, NYC for which Dr. White-Newsome works as their federal policy analyst.""

They were unable to complete the transit in one season because of ice.  They overwintered at Gjoa Haven in what is now Nunavut.  The voyage was continued the following summer.  This was the first successful attempt to negotiate the passage after a number of previous tries were unsuccessful including the Franklin Expedition in the 1850's which disappeared without a trace.  Evidence of the fate of Franklin and his men was not discovered until quite recently when larger and larger areas have become ice free.  The first time the Northwest Passage was done in one season was in the 1940's by the Canadian vessel *St Roch*.  The first commercial passage was in 1969 by the massive tanker/breaker *SS Manhattan* assisted at one time or another by 2 Canadian Coast Guard icebreakers and 2 from the US Coast Guard.  The planned passage could not be used due to ice so an alternate was chosen.

Fast forward to the last twenty years.  A number of vessels have made the passage without assistance, private yachts and cruise ships and military vessels frequent the area.  The Canadian Ice Patrol was discontinued in the 1980's.  

So the recently brought forward and isolated ""eyewitness accounts of open Arctic passages"" during the 1930's is not proof of much at all.  All attempts to pass through in one summer failed previous to *St Roch*.

Since the interview was of someone from WE ACT in Harlem, NY, representing residence who are mostly Black and Latino, and since poverty rates in the US too often fall along racial lines, particularly in a city like NYC, to me the connection is very clear. 

Climate Change is caused by the burning of fossil fuels. The pollution rate in Black and Latino neighborhoods where there is a large concentration of working poor and poor people along with working class and middle class, is much higher than in majority white neighborhoods only 60 blocks south. Both climate change activists and people in Harlem seeking environmental justice want to decrease fossil fuels emissions. Some plans (cap and trade) could potentially give a state the right to pollute in some places if they offset that pollution somewhere else. How do they decide WHERE to pollute? Historically it has been in poor urban neighborhoods with a majority of people of color. In the case of NYC, north of 92nd street, which until recently has have many communities that are virtually exclusively Black and Latino and is still mostly Black and Latino. 

If we pursue a plan to tax fossil fuels, with the result being a heavy increase of energy prices, the poor will disproportionately be affected, which in the USA includes heavy concentrations of people of color. Therefore in pursuing a carbon tax, we need to find ways to get that money back in the hand of the people who need it most.

"790","cjbci33","1","0","t1_cjb78i8","Let me do this point by point.

&gt;I guess you are saying the title I gave here in Reddit misrepresents the article that I linked. 

Correct.

&gt;Since the interview was of someone from WE ACT in Harlem, NY, representing residence who are mostly Black and Latino...

Yes, but the group formed to raise awareness about environmental issues related to a sewage treatment plant, not climate change.

&gt;...and since poverty rates in the US too often fall along racial lines, particularly in a city like NYC, to me the connection is very clear.

Here is your mistake.  In order for this to be about race you need to show some sort of link, no matter how tenuous, that climate change affects people of color more than people who are simply poor.  You and I would agree, I'm sure, that the poor are disproportionately affected by most everything.  That doesn't make everything about race.

&gt;The pollution rate in Black and Latino neighborhoods where there is a large concentration of working poor and poor people along with working class and middle class, is much higher than in majority white neighborhoods only 60 blocks south.

What you need to demonstrate here is that the pollution rate in poor white neighborhoods is not as bad as the pollution rate in Black and Latino neighborhoods.  There aren't just poor/minority neighborhoods and rich/white neighborhoods after all.

Further, you seem to be conflating pollution and climate change.  There are, for example, particulates released from coal plants that will affect nearby populations, but CO2 is rather homogenous and its effects will be global, not limited to neighborhood near power plants.

&gt;Historically it has been in poor urban neighborhoods with a majority of people of color.  In the case of NYC, north of 92nd street, which until recently has have many communities that are virtually exclusively Black and Latino and is still mostly Black and Latino.

Had the article stated some evidence of that, we wouldn't be having this conversation.  Given the number of power plants build near coal mines in the Appalachians and elsewhere, I am having a hard time accepting your claim at face value.

&gt;If we pursue a plan to tax fossil fuels, with the result being a heavy increase of energy prices  the poor will disproportionately be affected...

Yes, I very much agree with this.

&gt;...which in the USA includes heavy concentrations of people of color.

And also includes millions of white people.  Energy prices disproportionately affect poor people of all races.  There is no evidence whatsoever that poorer black people, for example, will pay more for energy than poorer white people.  I hope you are seeing that is is poverty, not race, that is the key variable here.

&gt;Therefore in pursuing a carbon tax, we need to find ways to get that money back in the hand of the people who need it most.

Ask yourself this.  Is your solution to give that money back based on income or skin color?  

&gt;Of course there are white poor people, but a larger percentage of the poor in the USA are people of color. 

About 1/3rd of Black and Latino people are poor according to your source, but there are about 1/7th of White people are poor.  Given that there are about six times as many White people in the U.S. as there are Black people, that gives roughly equivalent number of poor people of each race.

&gt;...but by interviewing a women of color who works for an organization that serves mostly people of color who I met while she spoke to a mostly white climate change group about environmental justice, I can still see the accuracy of the title...

Nothing she said seemed to support your title, though.  You could have taken a different angle with this entirely.  You could have noted how underrepresented people of color are as a percentage of climate activists, for example, but by trying to make it about the effects of climate change, you set yourself up for failure.  By being so expansive in your scope, you automatically set a high evidentiary bar.  The article didn't have the kind of evidence that such a claim needed, though.

&gt;Based on your reading, what title for Reddit would you suggest?

You could have gone a number of ways.  You could have stated that WE ACT, a Harlem environmental advocacy group, is now taking on climate change.  You could have stated that climate change disproportionately affects poor people.  But making it about racial discrimination really wasn't what the article was about.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2byzd6",1406666479,2014-07-29 20:41:19,"Will_Power"

This Atlantic article points out that race more than income affect the amount of pollution people in NYC and nearby cities face: http://www.citylab.com/design/2014/04/people-color-are-disproportionately-killed-air-pollution/8881/

Quote: Income also plays a role in pollution exposure, but not as much as you might think. ""Both race and income matter, but race matters more than income,"" says Julian Marshall, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Minnesota. ""And that's a really important point, because when you start talking about differences by race people say, 'Oh, that's just income.'""

The discrepancy is so great that even high-earning non-whites are sucking in relatively larger quantities of pollution. For a clear illustration of that, take a look at this graph showing (at top left) pollution/income differences for large urban areas. Notice how low-income whites are exposed to less pollution than even the highest-income blacks, Asians, and Hispanics:""
They then provide a useful graph. 

WE ACT is not simply concerned with a sewage treatment plant. They started with it in the 80's but very much are engaged in cleaning the air. When taking on Climate Change--putting a tax on carbon for instance--it will thankfully improve the pollution in Harlem, BUT if we do not also provide the means for citizens to pay for higher energy, the poor, of all color, will struggle to keep up. Since the poverty rate is higher for people of color in America (see my previous answer for those stats by state revealing a higher percentage of poor Blacks and Latinos throughout the US) disproportionately a larger percentage of people of color will suffer. 

Therefore, when taking on climate change, we need to consider who will be most affected. Both the affects of climate change and our responses to it will be experienced by people differently based on geography, income, and deeply entrenched discrimination. Climate activist need to partner with people of color in the US and beyond to develop strategies that will be just.

Just to give you a little background, I'm the sole mod here and happen to be a lukewarmer, so I try to keep this subreddit as centrist as possible.  (That might explain why it is so small: people gravitate to poles for some reason.)  You've provided a pretty long list, so I'll pick and choose what I respond to, and I'll necessarily keep my answers as brief as I can.  By the way, I'm not looking to help you ""shut this guy up.""  I'm looking to give you the best information I can so you can form your own opinions.

1)  Confirming the extent of mankind's influence on climate is indeed a challenging task.  Climate is, after all, a highly complex, chaotic system.  What's worse, people want to try to tie effects of climate (hurricanes, drought, floods) to specific inputs to that chaotic system, then tie specific results of *those* events (e.g., drought produces wildfires, although wildfires are just as much about forest management) back to the original inputs.  It's madness.

Thus, I think it is critical that we only look at a single metric, and that is global temperature.  So now we have our metric, all that's left is to look at temperature records, right?  Oh how I wish it were that simple.  We have pretty poor temperature records until perhaps a century ago, and those from that time were very limited in nature.  We have little sea temperature data prior to 1950 or so, and that which we did have was for the sea surface only.  The deep ocean, which acts as a huge heat sink, has no data of which I am aware before ~1950.  In fact, we really only have decent data for the deep sea for perhaps the last decade.

So you see the scope of the challenge in measuring global temperature.  Because of that, we have to use proxies to guess at past temperatures.  Proxies suggest that there were warmer temperatures than today during the present interglacial and that the previous interglacial was warmer than this one.  So now we have to take our best guess as to the factors that may have caused those periods to be warmer than today and compare those to the state of those factors today.

For example, the proxies we have for solar activity suggest the middle of last century was quite active.  The last time the sun was that active was at the beginning of the present interglacial; however, solar activity has been on the decline for the last few decades.

With all that said, I cannot agree with your wall-of-text generating friend that warming (if that is our sole metric) can only be measured on billion year scale.  I do think you do need to take at least a 60 year trend to account for the multi-decadal scales of ocean cycles that we are now beginning to understand.  Once you do, you can control for natural oscillations and solar variation and should have enough data to control give you a ballpark trend.  

So much for being brief.  I'll try harder on the next ones.

2) Experimental data is not really feasible in understanding global temperatures.  We don't get to have two earths and tweak the settings of one.  That's where climate models come in.  Unfortunately, general circulation models (GCMs) haven't had a very good showing of late.  Their biggest sources of uncertainty, in my opinion, are ocean cycles and cloud formation.  So does this mean that we have to have GCMs perfectly predicting global temperature to demonstrate effects from anthropogenic influence?  Probably not.  If we see, for example, a continued decline in solar activity but an increase on global temperatures, we can say that human influence is pretty clear.  I think the next decade will be very interesting in that regard.  

Your friend might note that most climate skeptics do accept that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations will indeed increase global temperatures.  There is enough data already to give us a ballpark range on transient climate response (TCR).  AR5 says 1.8°C per doubling of CO2.  Those on the skeptical side suggest it is 1.35°C or less.  The point being, there is pretty universal acceptance that increasing GHGs (like CO2) will lead to warming.

3)  There is clear evidence of warming during the 20th century.  Some of that was natural.  Some is due to mankind.  There is still much debate on how much is from each.  I suspect when he uses the term ""AGW"" he is referring to the higher projections of warming, so you two may be talking past each other.

4) He is correct.  That doesn't mean, however, that there is no merit to climate science.  

5) He is correct here as well.  A better question would be, is warming going to move us out of that range?  Is further warming expected given what we know about natural variability?

6) This is the whole crux of the debate.  If there were limited feedbacks, or net negative feedbacks, there wouldn't really be much to worry about.  Most climate scientists will acknowledge this.  The concern is indeed large net positive feedbacks.  Water vapor would be the largest of these.  There is not much complexity required to say, ""a little warming should produce more water vapor.""  It's very basic science.  What becomes complicated is what happens to that vapor.  If it remains vapor, then it is a strong positive feedback.  This can be experimentally verified in the lab.  If it forms clouds, on the other hand, it becomes a whole different story.  Feedback magnitude would reduce considerably and perhaps even become negative for some types of clouds.  This is one of the major failings of GCMs I mentioned before.

7)  Most of us have seen good hypotheses disproven.  That really doesn't have anything to do with how good or bad AGW is.

8)  Here is an example of what I cautioned against in my response to part 1.  This is why you limit the discussion to the sole metric of global temperature.  As a measure of good faith, you acknowledge that predicting outcomes of a chaotic system is a fools errand.

9)  There is a climate scientist, Tasmin Edwards, whose blog is http://allmodelsarewrong.com/.  The heading is the blog is ""ALL MODELS ARE WRONG...but some are useful...""  If you would like to build a bridge for discussion, show him her blog so he knows that climate scientists know the limits of model utility.

10) He is correct.  Observational data confirms or disproves a hypothesis; models don't.  Models are a tool, nothing more.  In the case of the One Metric we are discussing, models only help us refine our hypothesis.  In the end, it will be observation that decides all.

11) Much of the activist crowd does indeed subscribe to the sort of philosophy he describes.  That's one of the reasons the debate is so polarized.  It's also one of the reason so many people are dismissive of the whole debate.  If they find the people raising the alarm to be repellent, why would they care to listen any further?  Unfortunately, there is a small handful of climate scientists who also subscribe to such a misanthropic philosophy, just as there are some who have openly declared their Christianity as obligation, as they see it, to care for what they see as God's creation.  None of this has helped the issue at all.  You might encourage your friend to note that there are lots of climate scientists who don't see the world that way and are simply trying to understand the climate better.  A few of them have decided to become activists.  The ethics of scientists becoming activists would be a discussion all it's own.  The point would be not to judge the whole field by those who promote action.  I personally think many activists methods have actually resulted in less action than had they never been involved.

12)  My response to #11 covers this.

13)  This is true and many papers have been written to try to account for all of human activities.  Land use changes, a whole raft of GHGs, aerosols, etc. are all part of the science.

14)  He is correct.  Good scientists are always skeptical.

15)  This one is lab testable, and has been tested many times in controlled experiments, which is the method he favors.  He could test this one himself.  He is likely thinking on feedbacks when he stated this.

16)  Here you could point him to climate scientists on the skeptical end (Roy Spencer, Richard Lindzen, John Christy, etc.) who have discussed these very things.  Even they still expect warming from added CO2.

17)  We do see what he describes during the present ice age.  The question to ask him is what it would take to push us beyond these two strange attractors (chaos theory term).  Note as well that the bistability is within the context of the present ice age, but the present ice age is not the norm for the history of the planet.

18)  If you want to argue minutia with him, suggest that albedo varies with glaciation.  Ice at the poles is much harder to get rid of than glaciation in temperate zones.

19)  He is correct.  Humans were down to between 1,000 and 10,000 breeding pairs during the last glacial period, but a big damn volcano during that time didn't help.  The question to ask, again, is if there is no way to push behind the current high stability point.

20)  See part 1 to my response.  

21)  See part 1.

22)  There have indeed been episodes of lost data, and it only makes sense to reject datasets that don't include original data. Fortunately, there are lots of data sets out there.  

23)  I very much agree with him here.  I think organizations that proclaim the need for action on climate but simultaneously oppose nuclear power are absolute hypocrites.  You might point him to the open letter from Hansen, Wigley, Emanuel, and Caldeira from last fall promoting nuclear power.

24)  See previous.  Also note that climate science is policy agnostic for the most part.  Suggest he separate climate activists and policymakers from climate scientists.

25)  I half agree with him here.  Suggest we should be using nuclear in place of coal and see how he reacts.

26)  He is correct; however, policy is made on best guesses all the time.

I'm at the 10k limit. ","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2chk8k",1407090608,2014-08-03 18:30:08,"Will_Power"

28) Also true.  My suggestion would be to agree with him on things such as this.  It shows good faith.  Also suggest, though, that policy has never required absolute proof, only best guesses.

29) He is correct.  Bring him back to the One Metric.

30) If he agrees that climate is non-linear, ask would sorts of changes would push us beyond our upper bistable state.  For the rest, bring him back to the One Metric.

31) He is correct.  Note again the separation between scientists, policy makers (politicians), activists, and those who are looking to make a buck from policy changes.  It's quite possible to reject Al Gore entirely and still have a productive discussion about science.  I know a climate activist on reddit that has stated outright that Al Gore is a thieving, scheming bastard (or words to that effect).

"803","cjfzw7i","1","0","t3_2chvje","I like how you are approaching this.  I'm sorry to say that I don't think solar is all you are claiming it to be, but I think there is lots to be said for all the ways CO2 may be taken out of the air, often for beneficial use.  Let me give you the bad news, then the good news.

**The Bad News:**

It is true that solar PV panels have seen tremendous reductions over the last few years.  This coincided with China entering the market.  Their production capacity has made solar panels cheaper than ever.  This doesn't sound like bad news, right?

The bad news is that solar panels are only a portion of the cost of a whole system.  If you are talking about grid-scale PV, you've got land, inverters, transmission, etc.  If you are talking about installing solar on your house, there are inverters, breakers, wiring, etc.  The problem is that all the non-solar panel pieces aren't changing much in price.

Even at the currently historic low prices of solar panels, the payback period for a home system is well over 10 years.  

**The Good News:**

There are lots of ways to get CO2 out of the atmosphere.  You can grid up olivine and it will absorb CO2.  What's more interesting are proposal to use that CO2 as feedstock for synthesis of hydrocarbons for liquid fuel.  Of course that takes an energy input.  Maybe that will be solar, but I think nuclear energy is more likely to provide the steady 24/7 energy that is required in the near-ish term.  

What I find provides even more bang for the buck, as it were, is the proposal to fertilize areas of the ocean with iron.  A few parts per trillion of iron is enough to kickstart a full biocycle.  This starts with algae growth, which is the base of the oceanic food chain.  This would consume CO2 dissolved in the ocean and turn it into food.  Some of the waste product from fish would end up on the ocean floor, sequestering the carbon.

http://www.nature.com/news/dumping-iron-at-sea-does-sink-carbon-1.11028#/

""Each atom of added iron pulled at least 13,000 atoms of carbon out of the atmosphere by encouraging algal growth which, through photosynthesis, captures carbon. In a paper in Nature today, the team reports that much of the captured carbon was transported to the deep ocean, where it will remain sequestered for centuries — a 'carbon sink'.""

So I agree with the OP.  There's nothing saying that anthropogenic is inevitable, and in fact lots of ways to reduce or even utilize the CO2 that has been emitted.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2chvje",1407102649,2014-08-03 21:50:49,"Will_Power"

&gt;__Solar thermal energy__ (__STE__) is a form of energy and a technology for harnessing [solar energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy) to generate [thermal energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy) or electrical energy for use in industry, and in the residential and commercial sectors. The first installation of solar thermal energy equipment occurred in the Sahara desert approximately in 1910 and was a steam engine without a kettle and fire but with a mirror system for sun light collection to heat water for the needed steam pressure. Because of the influence of World War I, liquid fuel was better developed and the Sahara project was abandoned, only to be reused several decades later.

I encourage you to look at the comparative costs of energy from various sources:
https://theconversation.com/counting-the-hidden-costs-of-energy-12710

I don't mean to pick a fight, but you are mistaken if you believe that multiple renewables sources can fix the intermittency problem in most locales.  Solar, PV or thermal, only produces for 6-8 hours per day unless you are looking at some sort of storage schema, and then prices go up significantly.  I spent five years trying to get a rural community on solar.  Storage was more expensive than generation by a large margin.  Wind for baseload is a non-starter.  The wider net you cast to solve its intermittency problem, the larger number of customers you include as well, so the higher demand you must meet.

All of this is beside the point anyway.  If environmental NGOs really want emissions reductions, they should not oppose any sort of low-CO2 generation.  If some countries want nuclear, why oppose that?","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2dn0bm",1408744257,2014-08-22 21:50:57,"Will_Power"

This is one area where I really take issue with the IPCC.

At some point, they simply aren't economically viable.

It takes its name as a shortening of __cli__mate __fi__ction, much as [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) is often shortened to ""sci-fi"". While the two genres share some features in common and can both be regarded as part of the broader category of [speculative fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_fiction), they are separate genres. Cli-fi novels and films are often set in either the present or the near or distant future, but they can also be set in the past. Many cli-fi movies and novels raise awareness about the major threats that [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) and [global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming) present to life on Earth.

There are proposals for redistribution, of course, but I've heard all sorts of places advocates of the tax want to spend the money that I'm dubious it would actually be distributed fairly.  

What's more, it's very complicated to measure ""fair.""  Is it by income?  I'll use an example I've used several times before.  Suppose you have a widow in San Diego (mild climate) and a working couple who commutes to work in Phoenix with the same income as the widow.

&gt;and nobody wants to build new plants 

Where do you get that idea?  China, India, Russia, the UAE, etc. are all building new nuclear plants.

&gt;and we know Uranium is not enough to cover a century of energy production.

That's a myth that's been debunked again and again.  The Japanese process of extracting uranium from seawater has been demonstrated and can produce large quantities of uranium at around $120-180/lb.  Given the very low cost of fuel for nuclear power, it could be ten times that amount and nuclear would still be viable.  What's more, it assumes there will never be breeders, which we discuss next.

&gt;We would have to use other type of nuclear plants (like the one based on waste from Uranium and Plutonium but it's not even near the stage in which it can be used for energy production

You are talking about breeder reactors, and they are here today.  Russia is building its *second* breeder reactor as we write.

&gt;My hope are for solar on every house/building/warehouse...

That gives you energy for six hours per day, in the right locations, when the sun is shining.

&gt; New marine tide energy plants everywhere we could, off coast wind turbine and similar

You just talked about how breeders don't exist (they do), but tidal energy has not been built beyond experiments.  Offshore wind is intermittent and far more expensive that onshore wind.

Here's some information on comparative costs by source:

&gt;In the end large satellites in orbit around the Sun to collect its energy in big batteries and bring them to Earth trough our space elevators because rocket and re-entry management would be too expensive

I think we are likely to have fusion long before that.  Anyway, the space-solar project doesn't utilize batteries.  It sends energy via microwaves to collector stations on the ground.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2eyru8",1409598774,2014-09-01 19:12:54,"Will_Power"

Now come climate scientists' implausible explanations for why the 'hiatus' has passed the 15-year mark.



By
Matt Ridley
Sept. 4, 2014 7:20 p.m. ET

On Sept. 23 the United Nations will host a party for world leaders in New York to pledge urgent action against climate change. Yet leaders from China, India and Germany have already announced that they won't attend the summit and others are likely to follow, leaving President Obama looking a bit lonely. Could it be that they no longer regard it as an urgent threat that some time later in this century the air may get a bit warmer?

In effect, this is all that's left of the global-warming emergency the U.N. declared in its first report on the subject in 1990. The U.N. no longer claims that there will be dangerous or rapid climate change in the next two decades. Last September, between the second and final draft of its fifth assessment report, the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change quietly downgraded the warming it expected in the 30 years following 1995, to about 0.5 degrees Celsius from 0.7 (or, in Fahrenheit, to about 0.9 degrees, from 1.3).

Even that is likely to be too high. The climate-research establishment has finally admitted openly what skeptic scientists have been saying for nearly a decade: Global warming has stopped since shortly before this century began.

First the climate-research establishment denied that a pause existed, noting that if there was a pause, it would invalidate their theories. Now they say there is a pause (or ""hiatus""), but that it doesn't after all invalidate their theories.

Alas, their explanations have made their predicament worse by implying that man-made climate change is so slow and tentative that it can be easily overwhelmed by natural variation in temperature—a possibility that they had previously all but ruled out.

When the climate scientist and geologist Bob Carter of James Cook University in Australia wrote an article in 2006 saying that there had been no global warming since 1998 according to the most widely used measure of average global air temperatures, there was an outcry. A year later, when David Whitehouse of the Global Warming Policy Foundation in London made the same point, the environmentalist and journalist Mark Lynas said in the New Statesman that Mr. Whitehouse was ""wrong, completely wrong,"" and was ""deliberately, or otherwise, misleading the public.""

We know now that it was Mr. Lynas who was wrong. Two years before Mr. Whitehouse's article, climate scientists were already admitting in emails among themselves that there had been no warming since the late 1990s. ""The scientific community would come down on me in no uncertain terms if I said the world had cooled from 1998,"" wrote Phil Jones of the University of East Anglia in Britain in 2005. He went on: ""Okay it has but it is only seven years of data and it isn't statistically significant.""

If the pause lasted 15 years, they conceded, then it would be so significant that it would invalidate the climate-change models upon which policy was being built. A report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) written in 2008 made this clear: ""The simulations rule out (at the 95% level) zero trends for intervals of 15 yr or more.""

Well, the pause has now lasted for 16, 19 or 26 years—depending on whether you choose the surface temperature record or one of two satellite records of the lower atmosphere. That's according to a new statistical calculation by Ross McKitrick, a professor of economics at the University of Guelph in Canada.

It has been roughly two decades since there was a trend in temperature significantly different from zero. The burst of warming that preceded the millennium lasted about 20 years and was preceded by 30 years of slight cooling after 1940.

This has taken me by surprise. I was among those who thought the pause was a blip. As a ""lukewarmer,"" I've long thought that man-made carbon-dioxide emissions will raise global temperatures, but that this effect will not be amplified much by feedbacks from extra water vapor and clouds, so the world will probably be only a bit more than one degree Celsius warmer in 2100 than today. By contrast, the assumption built into the average climate model is that water-vapor feedback will treble the effect of carbon dioxide.

But now I worry that I am exaggerating, rather than underplaying, the likely warming.

Most science journalists, who are strongly biased in favor of reporting alarming predictions, rather than neutral facts, chose to ignore the pause until very recently, when there were explanations available for it. Nearly 40 different excuses for the pause have been advanced, including Chinese economic growth that supposedly pushed cooling sulfate particles into the air, the removal of ozone-eating chemicals, an excess of volcanic emissions, and a slowdown in magnetic activity in the sun.

The favorite explanation earlier this year was that strong trade winds in the Pacific Ocean had been taking warmth from the air and sequestering it in the ocean. This was based on a few sketchy observations, suggesting a very tiny change in water temperature—a few hundredths of a degree—at depths of up to 200 meters.

Last month two scientists wrote in Science that they had instead found the explanation in natural fluctuations in currents in the Atlantic Ocean. For the last 30 years of the 20th century, Xianyao Chen and Ka-Kit Tung suggested, these currents had been boosting the warming by bringing heat to the surface, then for the past 15 years the currents had been counteracting it by taking heat down deep.

The warming in the last three decades of the 20th century, to quote the news release that accompanied their paper, ""was roughly half due to global warming and half to the natural Atlantic Ocean cycle."" In other words, even the modest warming in the 1980s and 1990s—which never achieved the 0.3 degrees Celsius per decade necessary to satisfy the feedback-enhanced models that predict about three degrees of warming by the end of the century—had been exaggerated by natural causes. The man-made warming of the past 20 years has been so feeble that a shifting current in one ocean was enough to wipe it out altogether.

Putting the icing on the cake of good news, Xianyao Chen and Ka-Kit Tung think the Atlantic Ocean may continue to prevent any warming for the next two decades. So in their quest to explain the pause, scientists have made the future sound even less alarming than before. Let's hope that the United Nations admits as much on day one of its coming jamboree and asks the delegates to pack up, go home and concentrate on more pressing global problems like war, terror, disease, poverty, habitat loss and the 1.3 billion people with no electricity.

"921","ckmwu56","1","0","t3_2gs5rr","Klein is getting a lot of criticism for her pipe dream of immediately banning fossil fuels and converting to renewables.  A recent reason.com critique of her book described what she's advocating:

&gt;""We need a Marshall Plan for the Earth,"" Klein declares, updating one of the most tired historical metaphors for her purposes. ""It is entirely possible to rapidly switch our energy systems to 100 percent renewables,"" she asserts. As an example of ""one of several credible studies"" showing how such a vast energy transformation could be achieved, she breezily cites a 2009 Energy Policy paper by two researchers, Mark Jacobson of Stanford and Mark Delucchi of the University of California, Davis. Jacobson and Delucchi think we can replace all coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear power by 2030 with wind, solar, and hydropower while fueling a fleet of electric cars. How? By deploying 3.8 million 5-megawatt wind turbines, 5,350 100-megawatt geothermal plants, 500,000 1-megawatt tidal turbines, 720,000 0.75-megawatt wave power generators, 1.7 billion 3-kilowatt rooftop solar panels, 40,000 300-megawatt solar panel farms, and 49,000 300-megawatt concentrated solar power plants.
&gt;
&gt;Sound easy? Well, if the world were to begin deploying these renewable energy technologies next year that would mean erecting approximately 250,000 wind turbines each year for the next 15 years. As of the end of 2012, there were a total of 225,000 wind turbines operating around the world.
&gt;
&gt;Similarly, the world would have to install 113 million rooftop solar panel systems per year in order to meet the 2030 goal of 1.7 billion. In 2013, the U.S. installed a record 4,751 megawatts of solar panels, which would be roughly equivalent to 1.6 million 3-kilowatt rooftop solar panels. As of 2013, the entire world had installed 100 gigawatts (100 million kilowatts) of solar photovoltaic panels. Combining the rooftop and solar panel proposals, this hyper-solarization would mean deploying more than 10 times the current installed capacity of photovoltaic panels, not just once but every year for the next 15 years. And never mind that there are virtually no commercial wave or tidal energy production systems currently operating.
&gt;
&gt;Klein never ever discusses how much her solutions to the climate crisis will cost. But Delucchi and Jacobson estimate a price tag of about $100 trillion for their program. That entails spending about $6.6 trillion per year from now until 2030, more than 11 percent of the entire world's 2013 output of $75 trillion. Such a crash plan for global energy transformation might be possible, but it would be a massive shift from our current course. Bloomberg New Energy Finance projected in July 2014 that $7.7 trillion total will be invested in building new power plants between now and 2030, of which renewables will get around two-thirds. And Klein accuses the proponents of free markets of ""magical thinking""?","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2gs5rr",1411147737,2014-09-19 17:28:57,"Will_Power"

"940","ckx88pl","0","0","t1_ckx6of0","I'm sleepy, so I'll make this as brief as I can.  Since you are asking for an ELI5 version, I'll be (probably overly) simplistic.

There is general agreement that the **direct** effect of doubling the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere should increase global temperatures by about 1°C on average.  Where there is a lot of disagreement, and a lot less confidence, is in the magnitude of feedbacks.  There are positive and negative feedbacks in the climate system.  A positive feedback is one that turns a little warming into more warming, where a negative feedback is one that would reduce that theoretical 1°C warming.

The general assumption has been that as the planet warms, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere will increase due to increased evaporation.  Water vapor is a greenhouse gas like CO2, so that should be a pretty significant positive feedback.  Climate sensitivity is the best guess as to how much temperature will rise once those feedbacks are accounted for.

The problem is that it is really hard to quantify how strong that feedback will be because some of the water vapor will turn into clouds, and clouds *might* actually be a negative feedback.  What's more, some of that will fall as precipitation.  It's all very hard to pin down, and that's just one feedback.

It is true that estimates of climate sensitivity were reduced from the IPCC's fourth assessment report (AR4) and the most recent one (AR5).  There have been a few papers since AR5 that suggest it should be lowered a bit more.

&gt;Does this mean that scientists produced predictions with a political agenda in mind?

It would be foolish to assume that scientists are free of politics and bias.  I think that the majority of climate scientists are probably decent folk, but there are some with very clear political agendas.  Michael Mann and Phil Jones come to mind.  

&gt;If so, what kind of repercussions does that have on the Climate Change movement?

As of right now, climate change activists have opted to ignore it for the most part.  Their rhetoric has changed from the amount of warming we should expect to extreme weather events.  In this regard, they've made a big mistake because the IPCC put out a special report on extreme weather events a couple of years ago (the IPCC SREX) that said that presently observed extreme weather events are either the same as usual or in slight decline.

&gt;Obviously the actual data shows an upward trend of about 0.1 points...is this detrimental? It doesn't appear to be very meaningful when the model predicted 0.9

It is certainly not something climate activists are pointing to.  Most seem to expect a resumption of warming very soon now.  A few have said that the warming may not return for another 15 years.  It is really hard to make the case that 0.1-0.2°C over 30 years is much to worry about.  Those who worry a lot about climate change point out that it isn't just temperatures, but things like ocean acidification and rising sea levels that are worrisome.  There is still the die hard bunch that will tell you that melting permafrost is going to release a methane bomb that will result in several degrees warming over the next 80 years, but they really don't have any scientific support to speak of.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2hyktf",1412139949,2014-10-01 05:05:49,"Will_Power"

This article is junk and their chart is junk, but they're in the right direction. Climate sensitivity, a multiplier effect of sorts for predicting total future warming for given amounts of CO2e, is a decisive factor in the current climate debate. Variation on this number accounts for a large proportion of the variation in predicted warming and its effects, and by extension the potential economic harms that policymakers may need to take action to prevent. The difference between a sensitivity of 1.0 to 4.0 makes the difference between 'maybe not a problem' to 'imminent threat'. This was illustrated in the Obama administration's recent attempt to harmonize disparate estimates for the economic cost of CO2 emissions, with models outputting numbers as low as $0/ton to $100/ton depending on the assumptions fed into them.

Here is a better illustration, also from a skeptic-leaning source, which shows many recent sensitivity estimates alongside IPCC AR4/5 ranges:

&gt;Does this mean that scientists produced predictions with a political agenda in mind?

While I suspect many prominent scientists have a bias, I believe the large majority of them to be fundamentally acting in good faith; Regardless, they publish plausible work that others can review. The agenda, as I see it, is imparted in how these findings are presented to the public, and are filtered up to higher levels of organization. The IPCC reports themselves contain confidence intervals for climate sensitivity (included in the above-linked chart). While I believe their estimates to be biased upwards, even taken at face value, there is no attempt made to hide the lack of consensus on this key issue in the low-level publications.

However, the way this research is reported to the public, one would never get the impression that debate even exists for such a simple question - how much output for a given input? This is the question on which actual policy pivots, and yet few outside the small percentage who follow the issue closely are even aware of what sensitivity estimates are.

&gt;If so, what kind of repercussions does that have on the Climate Change movement?

The public-facing climate change movement has largely ignored this issue, instead trying to keep attention focused on the 'settled science' of the greenhouse effect. This is a sideshow, as there are few skeptics who deny the basic mechanisms of global warming. The climate change movement keeps the scientific discussion confined to this simple strawman, while relying on perceived weather and climate extremes to serve as evidence that they are in the right. The repercussions may become unavoidable if observed warming continues to be below forecasts.

It is important which part of ""the climate change movement"" we are discussing, as such a movement seems to have many heads that say conflicting things. Activists assure the world of a scientific consensus on dangerous or catastrophic warming, while IPCC reports can't even rule out with a minimum of statistical confidence the possibility of merely lukewarm changes. Activists point to floods, droughts, and hurricanes as proof of our worsening world, while the IPCC's own reports on these subjects can't even say with confidence that there have been any changes in these events at all, much less that they are clearly a result of a warming climate.

TL;DR: Sensitivity is the most important variable for public policy, and it's likely value has been debated for years, and recently revised downward. The environmental movement continues to ignore this lack of consensus, and tells the public half-truths that have yet to be borne out by observed data.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2hyktf",1412142294,2014-10-01 05:44:54,"nogodsorkings1"

The first study discussed examined a small group of petroleum engineers in Alberta, Canada. The point of the study wasn't to determine whether scientists think that climate change is happening or anthropogenic, it was to examine how the participants in an industry that is existentially threatened by climate change mitigation strategies justify their expertise and opinion when arguing against climate change. The whole point was that these are individuals who are going against the scientific grain, because they are members of the the petroleum industry, and the researchers wanted to figure out why.

Secondly, the author of this piece clearly doesn't understand how science works. Science proceeds by degrees of confidence; nothing is literally 100% certain. No respectable scientist would ever publish material that doesn't leave room for error. So when a scientist says ""likely"", ""probable"", or the like, it means that they have found to some degree of confidence (usually 95%, or 99%) that a proposition is true.

As far as the American Meteorological Society report is concerned, the author draws exactly the wrong conclusions. First, they acknowledge that there is sufficient evidence to determine the heat wave in Australia and the drought in California *were* caused by anthropogenic climate change. Second, the report doesn't say that severe weather events *weren't* caused by ACC, just that they can't determine that they were.

More to the point, this doesn't ""disprove"" climate change in any relevant way, it just means that what they found is within the margin of normal climate variability and that there weren't any events (in 2013) that were SO severe or out of the realm of normal climate variation that scientists were comfortable claiming that ACC caused them.

As an illustration, imagine that there is a city that receives, on average, 100 inches of rain a year. On any given year, that amount of rain may vary 5 inches. So, any year with 95-105 inches of rain is within the normal range. If there are 106 inches of rain one year, it would be reasonable to observe an anthropogenic signal, as the event was without normal climate variability. In a year with 105 inches, one would not be able to confidently do so. That does not mean that those extra 5 inches were caused by natural variability, but it isn't scientifically sound to declare that they were *not* caused by natural variability (i.e. to reject the null hypothesis).

For some time now I've pointed out that we use the cheapest fossil fuels first, often referred to as the ""low hanging fruit.""  A decade ago oil companies were making profits when oil was $25-30/bbl.  Today, tar sands and tight Bakken oil production stops when prices get much below $80/bbl.  Clearly the cost of production has gone up on average, even for the Saudis, who need something like $80-90/bbl to support their social services and prevent the kinds of riots typical of the Arab Spring.  

The same is generally true of coal and natural gas, though we have a glut of the latter right now due to huge investments in drilling/fracking after the housing bubble burst and investment capital needed someplace to go.

The fossil fuel reserves that are actually economically extractable are far fewer than the hydrocarbons in the ground that are called ""technically extractable.""  The result?  Fossil fuels are self-taxing.  

Combine this with other energy sources available to us, and I think you might be right in doubting your activism.

Do humans emit a lot of it?  Will increases in CO2 result in warming?  Yes, yes, and yes.  Those things have a high level of scientific support and there are few people who are skeptical of any of those answers.

Skeptics and warmists, if I may use that term, generally agree that the **direct** effect of doubling CO2 from pre-industrial levels would be an increase in temperature of about 1.1°C.  Where the two camps diverge is on the question of feedbacks.  Those concerned about climate change believe that the climate system is dominated by positive feedbacks; that is, a little warming has follow-on effects that lead to more warming.  Skeptics believe that net feedbacks are either slightly positive, neutral, or slightly negative.  

The level of scientific understanding (LOSU) is far lower when it comes to feedbacks than it is on the main questions I listed above.  Climate sensitivity, which accounts for these feedbacks, has a very wide range of estimates at present, with those coming from General Circulation Models (GCMs) generally being on the high end and those coming from observationally constrained models coming in on the low end.

Despite what some of the more vocal advocates of policy would have you believe, the debate over the magnitude and complexity of feedbacks is very real and rolls on.  Those who understand this but still advocate for action thus suggest we follow the precautionary principal in terms of policy.  They say that if climate sensitivity turns out to be large then we have avoided catastrophe; if it turns out to be small, then no harm done.  Of course there's debate over that as well.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2j4llw",1413263220,2014-10-14 05:07:00,"Will_Power"

Don't you secretly think we can get cell phones on guerrilla glass displays, build hardware that moves when we move, use nanobots to eliminate disease - and what ever happened to hover boards? Well, there's not going to be much of a future if we don't get our relationship with the environment figured out. 

What I like to tell people when I defend where tech is going - is that if we can get Western societies to buy into spending their days and time, building digital applications, and story-telling online, we can eliminate some forms of physical commerce, thereby hopefully reducing our dependency on raw materials...and supporting the environment. There's not going to be much of a technical future if we don't make some changes in how we live. It's hard to get entire nations to make drastic changes - and laws only go so far, but I think every incremental piece of progress helps. 

Right now, I'm taking acting classes at the Meisner Technique Studio (self - plug), and my studio is working on something really cool. Studio Director Jim Jarrett has gotten Producer Barry Osborne (Lord of the Rings! The Matrix!) on board to help produce a film about the climate debate called, ""Talk is Cheap"". The movie is about a famous radio personality, and his daughter, who decides that talk is cheap, and that taking a vow of silence is the best way for her generation to bring climate change to the world's attention. 

The filmmakers are launching a Kickstarter campaign on October 16, 2014 and the kick is - that every individual is only allowed to contribute $1. The campaign hopes to raise $1.5 million dollars through a real grassroots effort.

I keep reading this over and over again.  For some reason it is Watts' claim to fame thingy.  There is a protocol for placing thermometers and some have been poorly placed in the past.  I recall working as a weather observer many years ago in Northern Canada.  During periods of extreme cold the ""official"" temperature could be raised a bit when the wind blew from the direction of our building about 100 meters away from the thermometer.  

Urban areas are warmer than uninhabited areas but what many people fail to think about is that the percentage of the earth that is urbanised has increased enormously in the past few decades.  It is also a contributor to warming and it is real.  Just like deforestation.  I have heard people suggest temperatures from urbanised areas should be disregarded.  WTF?  These temperatures are real.  If all temps were measured in urban areas and none outside in unpopulated areas this could be an issue but urban sprawl is real.  The little city I live in is four times the size it was 10 years ago.  The big city down the road is 50% larger than it was 15 years ago.  The fact that a temp is taken in an urban area does not make it suspect.  Blaming urban heat islands for erroneous temps is very poor thinking.  If the whole surface were urbanised the planet would be too hot to live on.  The fraction of the earth's surface covered by urban areas is much greater than it was a few decades ago.  This was recognised and accounted for long before Anthony Watts had his brilliant insight.

This is just one little issue that should never have been a serious talking point.  It was meaningless when it first surfaced and means less than nothing now.  Do people think that those of us working in the field did not understand this stuff forty years ago?  Do these same people also realise it is usually warmer during the day than at night?  Warmer in summer than winter?  It gets tiresome.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2j4llw",1413525296,2014-10-17 05:54:56,"Long_dan"

I do not know what to make of this.  The warming idea did not spring like Minerva from Michael Mann's brow.  It took us a long time to figure out it was happening and frankly many of the arguments put forward by the first denialists were so poorly conceived in a scientific sense that it became hard to take any of them seriously.  There are some big unanswered questions but they are not the ones you hear about in the popular press and are not usually discussed outside of academic and scientific circles.  It is hard to treat people seriously when even their questions and their particular doubts are ignorantly formed.  

The big questions don't usually get kicked around on reddit.  They would likely bore the average crank because those questions are primarily in the more esoteric and poorly understood areas of the science.  Not exactly the province of the ""layman civilian science critic"".
It might be a little more informing to ask the leading proponents of the warming paradigm where *their* doubts lie..not their relative certainties.  So many of the skeptics have been bashing their collective heads against the well established facts they don't get to the interesting stuff.  It took a long time to get the majority of scientists to agree it was getting warmer and then even longer for them to agree it was probably us.  A large proportion of the contrarian crowd are hanging around in between part one and part two.  It is like those folks who say ""If evolution is real how come there are still monkeys"".

There is a sharp difference in what is green and what is stupid and what is practicable.  Developing safe nuclear power should be a crash priority as well as renewables.   Right now we are using 1960's technology for nuclear power generation.  We have to do better than that.  The fossil lobby does everything they can to stop this.  The downside of this for Americans is they will be fossil fuel dependent while other countries take the lead in renewables and nuclear technology and once again the USA's energy will be under someone elses control.

That dickbag james3563 has a very valid point even if he is a dickbag.  The third world people need energy to make their standard of living even comparable to what we consider acceptable.

Global warming is just a bunch of hooey.  It's a political invention of those who want to give communism another shot.""

So it really is a puzzle.  If you want large countries to make rapid change, you need something damn near an autocracy.  I think if people started pushing really hard for such concentrated, centralized power in the U.S. it would result in civil war and the dissolution of the union.  

On the other hand, change has happened in our Washington, D.C. sausage factory.  The EPA was created due to popular pressure, and the early results were quite good.  We have cleaner water and air that we used to.  Of course now, as that particular institution has aged, it has tended to overreach, waste and dysfunction.

&gt;

&gt;__Milankovitch theory__ describes the collective effects of changes in the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)'s movements upon its [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate), named after [Serbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia) [geophysicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics) and [astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy) [Milutin Milanković](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milutin_Milankovi%C4%87), who worked on it during his internment as a [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War) [prisoner of war (POW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war). Milanković mathematically theorized that variations in [eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentricity_(orbit\)), [axial tilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt), and [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession) of the Earth's orbit determined climatic patterns on Earth through [orbital forcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_forcing).

&gt;The Earth's [axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_Axis) completes one full cycle of [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession) approximately every 26,000 years. At the same time the [elliptical orbit rotates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession) more slowly. The combined effect of the two precessions leads to a 21,000-year period between the [astronomical seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season#Astronomical) and the orbit. In addition, the angle between Earth's rotational axis and the normal to the plane of its orbit ([obliquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obliquity)) oscillates between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees on a 41,000-year cycle. It is currently 23.44 degrees and decreasing.

&gt;Similar astronomical theories had been advanced in the 19th century by [Joseph Adhemar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Adhemar), [James Croll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Croll) and others, but verification was difficult due to the absence of reliably dated evidence and doubts as to exactly which periods were important. Not until the advent of deep-ocean cores and a seminal paper by [Hays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hays), [Imbrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Imbrie), and [Shackleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Shackleton), ""Variations in the Earth's Orbit: Pacemaker of the Ice Ages"", in *[Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_(journal\))* (1976)  did the theory attain its present state.

"1026","clilhfo","-27","0","t3_2k4xe0","I'm a centrist on this issue (often referred to as ""lukewarmer""), so here's my take on this.  Climate change is a far more nuanced field than those from either extreme would have you believe.  Within the scientific community there is near universal agreement on the basics (e.g., CO2 is a greenhouse gas, humans emit a lot of it. etc.).  Most scientists also agree that the **direct** effect (i.e., the Stefan-Boltzmann equilibrium) of doubling CO2 in the atmosphere would be a temperature increase of about 1.1°C, all else being equal.  

Of course all else isn't equal, so they try to estimate the effects from feedbacks.  The estimate of temperature change accounting for all feedbacks is referred to as climate sensitivity.  *There is far less certainty regarding climate sensitivity than there is on the basics I just mentioned.*  There is a very wide range of estimates of climate sensitivity within the scientific literature; nevertheless, the general recommendation is that nations should reduce their CO2 emissions to be on the safe side.  

A point that is often lost in the screaming match that surrounds this issue is that there are good, decent scientists all over the spectrum of opinion on what should be done and how quickly emissions must be reduced.  Each pole of the debate picks a few scientists that confirm their own biases and discount the rest.

Outside of the scientific community, **business interests on both sides are pushing on policy**.  It is true that fossil fuel companies really don't want a carbon tax and have funded efforts to maintain business as usual.  It is also true that there are a lot of investors who have placed their bets on solar and wind companies that really want to see carbon taxes or other policy give them a competitive advantage.  **The sad truth is that both sides have found useful idiots to carry their flag, and both sides misrepresent the science.**  On one end you have people denying that humans affect the climate at all, on the other you have people who would have you believe that climate change is an existential crisis to mankind.

The reason I created this subreddit was to try to focus on what climate science actually says, warts and all.  Unfortunately, people love to jump into the fray, fighting for either extreme, so there are few readers here, and I still have to delete both alarmist and denialist submissions every week.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2k4xe0",1414166614,2014-10-24 16:03:34,"Will_Power"

"1083","cllftki","7","0","t1_clld6h0","First of all, I question why you're presenting this guy's blog as an example of good science. As far as I can tell, he has no background in research science other than a Bachelor's degree in Geology and a Masters in Electrical Engineering. He has no publications besides his blog and a few opinion pieces in The Register (one of which he famously had to retract due to straight up lying about his data). So it's all fine and good to say ""look, this guy knows what's up,"" but he has absolutely nothing in the way of credibility. While he's posting rudely worded smears of the scientific community, real scientists are maintaining their credibility with things like landing an SUV sized rover on Mars using a rocket powered sky crane and creating the flu vaccine. 

But setting aside his lack of credibility, he also fundamentally doesn't understand the point of averages and statistical trends. Outliers happen, and they aren't always statistically significant, which is why the 1936 heat wave and freeze don't really matter when you're looking at the long term trend of climate. What matters is when annual averages rise over a larger period of time than a year, and that's exactly what we see with the current climate.

Here's an analogy. Say you're monitoring the progress of a college professor to evaluate improvement in their teaching methods. How are you going to do that? In any given class, there are some kids who do a fantastic job, getting high A+ grades, and there are some kids who don't give a damn and flunk the class. So the best way to evaluate this teacher's performance over time is going to be the average class grade each semester.

So the teacher starts out and his students have an average of a 80% for his first semester of teaching. The next year, the average is a little higher, 82%, and the year after that it's 83%. Assuming the class difficulty is the same, would you say the professor is getting better at teaching? Now in his fourth year, something weird happens. An unprecedented number of students get A+ grades, 96% or higher, but at the same time an unprecedented number fail with 50% or lower. It's strange, but his average still ends up being an 84%. The next year, the average is an 86%, and the year after that, the average is an 87%. 

So that fourth year, should we say that was a statistically significant year? Or was it an outlier? does it mean that the teacher isn't improving? No. In all likelihood, it was simply a unique group of students. It doesn't break the overall trend.

Now the professor is in his 7th year, and the average is a 88%, and in the 8th year it's a 90%. Clearly this teacher is improving his techniques and his students are more comfortable with the material each year. In his 9th year, he has surprisingly few students receive A+ grades in the class, but also not many fail. The average still ends up being a 92%. Would you look at that year and say ""wow, not many A+'s there, this teacher clearly isn't improving. Time to let him go.""

**En uppsättning rapporter av den mellanstatliga panelen för klimatförändringar (IPCC), sist som släpptes den 2 November, 2014, sätter scenen för regeringar att förnya sina ansträngningar på frågan genom ambitiösa åtaganden för ett heltäckande klimatavtal i Paris i December 2015.**

Syntesen släppt den här veckan och tidigare tre volymer av rapporterna har tydligt etablerat bevis om klimatförändringar den sannolikt irreversibla skadan på kritiska ekosystem och sårbarhet för mänskliga och ekonomiska system. Det finns ett smalt fönster av möjligheter att minska utsläppen så att vi kan garantera temperaturstegringen stannar inom målet 2 grader Celsius (C) i slutet av detta århundrade.

I Asien och Stillahavsområdet finns det ett särskilt behov att ta itu med denna fråga. Senaste utvecklingen vinster att vändas på grund av klimatpåverkan är väl förstådda. Den andra volymen av IPCC-rapporten, effekter, anpassning och sårbarhet, släppt i mars 2014, tydligt beskrivas skadorna på de [fysiska och ekonomiska systemen](http://westwardalternatives.com/) i vår region.

Regionen är en stora geografiska utbredning som också hem till den största populationen av världens fattiga, vilket gör det särskilt känsliga för effekterna av klimatförändringarna. Dessa effekter omfattar vattenstress, livsmedelsförsörjning, kustnära översvämningar och erosion, förde med sig risken för utrotning av terrestrial och sötvatten arter och ökad prevalens av vektorburna sjukdomar.

Anpassning till dessa är sättet att gå framåt. Men det finns gränser, som tydligt har erkänts av IPCC. Detta gör rollen som riskreducerande eller minska utsläppen av växthusgaser (GHG) central till något svar till klimatförändringarna. Så nu är IPCC tydligt erkänna komplementariteten mellan anpassning och begränsning i samband med globala hållbara utvecklingen.

Vad är kanske inte helt uppskattat i regionen Asien och Stillahavsområdet är utbudet av möjligheter för grönare de stora infrastrukturbehov i regionen – att tillväxt är grön och hållbar samtidigt utvecklingsmässiga behov för folket.

Den tredje volymen av IPCC-trilogin, begränsning av klimatförändringar, släpptes i April 2014 visar att ungefär hälften av de sammanlagda antropogena utsläpp av växthusgaser mellan 1750 och 2010 har inträffat under de senaste 40 åren.

Utan positiva begränsningsåtgärder, temperaturen ökar i slutet av detta århundrade kan vara allt från 3,7-4,8 grader C. IPCC har postulerade att utsläppsminskningar globalt på mellan 40% och 70% från nuvarande nivåer måste uppnås 2050 ha en rimlig chans att som innehåller temperaturökningen till 2 grader C — den tröskel som man enats om internationellt att undvika omvälvande effekter.

Konsekvenserna för Asien är att regionen 2050 har att minska sina utsläpp till 50% av 2010 nivåer, för att bidra till detta mål. Hur regionen kommer att svara på denna utmaning kommer att kritiskt avgöra banan för att ändra klimatet.

I ADBS halvtidsöversynen av strategin 2020 sätter vi klimatförändringarna som en av de sju prioriteringarna för ADBS verksamhet. Vi har fastställt ett mål för investeringar i ren energi, hållbara transporter, förbättrad anpassning, integrera katastrof riskhantering och anpassning. Genom våra övergripande mål att minska fattigdomen och inkluderande och miljömässigt hållbar tillväxt också målet att öka motståndskraften i regionen. Cirka 45% av vår portfölj kommer att bekämpa klimatförändringarna, och vi hoppas att fördubbla våra investeringar i anpassning till över $2 miljarder år 2016.

Det kritiska elementet är dock hur länder genom sin inhemska politik garantera lämplig finansiering och incitament att ändra deras utsläpp bana, och integrera förändring klimathänsyn i ekonomiska och utvecklingspolitiken. Många i regionen har tagit lovvärda initiativ, men det kollektiva Svaren blir tillräckligt att vända? Det återstår för att se.

Possibly even a little too basic, but it does link to studies where you can learn more. When it's talking about ""the type of carbon that comes from fossil fuels,"" it's referring to the fact that CO2 from burning fossil fuels has a different carbon isotope ratio than CO2 from volcanoes or other natural sources. There's an explanation of that available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXgDrr6qiUk

And a more detailed one here: http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/outreach/isotopes/stable.html

The same site also has an overview of nine studies (with links to the studies) that attempted to calculate the contribution of humans to warming over the last 25-150 years: http://skepticalscience.com/a-comprehensive-review-of-the-causes-of-global-warming.html

Here's the conclusion:

&gt;Every study concluded that over the most recent 100-150 year period examined, humans are responsible for at least 50% of the observed warming, and most estimates put the human contribution between 75 and 90% over that period.  Over the most recent 25-65 years, every study put the human contribution at a minimum of 98%, and most put it at well above 100%, because natural factors have probably had a small net cooling effect over recent decades.

More conservatively, the latest IPCC report stated that:

&gt;It is extremely likely [95 percent confidence] more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together.

&gt;The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period. [...] The observed warming since 1951 can be attributed to the different natural and anthropogenic drivers and their contributions can now be quantified. Greenhouse gases contributed a global mean surface warming likely to be in the range of 0.5°C to 1.3 °C over the period 1951−2010, with the contributions from other anthropogenic forcings, including the cooling effect of aerosols, likely to be in the range of −0.6°C to 0.1°C. The contribution from natural forcings is likely to be in the range of −0.1°C to 0.1°C, and from internal variability is likely to be in the range of −0.1°C to 0.1°C.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2ocrk8",1417786874,2014-12-05 13:41:14,"ClimateMom"

"1153","cmnurbl","3","0","t1_cmm0eiu","&gt; The problem is that CO2 is not the most important greenhouse gas; water vapor is.

True, but irrelevant. Water vapor content in the atmosphere varies by orders of magnitude on both short time and spatial scales. However, in the global average, it doesn't really, because the balance of precipitation versus evaporation fundamentally constrains the movement of energy in the atmosphere (see [Oort and Peixoto, 1992](http://www.amazon.com/Physics-Climate-Jose-P-Peixoto/dp/0883187124)).

On the other hand, CO2 steadily rises.

If you add a sine wave and a line together, you got a sine wave tilted upwards. 

&gt; As CO2 levels increase it's ability to trap radiation acutally diminishes substantiallly.

Also true but irrelevant; atmospheric levels of CO2 are nowhere near saturating all the modes of absorption. The many overtones of ro-vibrational modes can go a  *long* way before you should expect the simplest estimates of CO2's radiative forcing to break down.

&gt; Water vapor is by far the biggest greenhouse gas and is incredibly poorly modeled, if at all.

Water vapor *is* modeled by **every** climate model. It's fundamental. Do you have any citation backing up your assertion that it's ""poorly modeled?"" 

&gt; To answer your question, we don't know and we don't have enough data. Long-term temperature records aren't that reliable, accurate, or global. We've only had satellite records for 35 years and there's been no warming for about half of that record.

Which is why we drive to understand the physics, chemistry, and dynamics of the climate system - to make progress where we're observationally-constrained. We do not have direct evidence of gravitational waves, yet we have the immensely powerful general relativity which predicts them. Until recently, we did not have direct evidence of the Higgs boson, yet we have a powerful and successful Standard Model and related theories which predicted it.

Besides, the existing temperature record unambiguously shows warming. You can do a lot more than just plot global mean temperatures if you wish to understand what *caused* that warming.

&gt; Man made climate change is a hypothesis which hasn't been proven. There's no smoking gun. The satellite data is showing that there has been no appreciable warming in the last 15-18 years yet we have put 30% more CO2 into the atmosphere. 

Internal variability dominates the signal in global temperature on short (less than 30 year) timescales. It's simply *wrong* to try to extrapolate the tendency in the climate system from such few years of data - *particularly* when you pin the beginning of that subset of data to a very strong El Nino, which skews any statistical analysis of the trend you might wish to do.

Why don't you use *all* the satellite data and re-evaluate that paragraph? I can answer for you: because then there is an unambiguous warming trend.

By the way, science doesn't deal in proof. You want /r/mathematics.

&gt;  Climate scientists projections have been wildly inaccurate over the years.

Climate scientists have never said that there is high confidence in decadal-scale climate projection. Again - on that timescale, internal variability dominates. So it's a curious benchmark for evaluating the science, kind of like asking a police officer why he failed to put out a house fire.

&gt; The jury is still out for anyone that actually looks at the data. Others buy into it whole-heartedly because that's what they've been taught.

It's not. [The science is in](http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_ALL_FINAL.pdf) - human activity is leading to climate change.

&gt;As Hagee explained, the views put forth by scientists and experts on any subject are not to be believed if those views are at odds with what the Bible teaches. As such, the extreme weather events that the climate has been experiencing are not the result of climate change but are rather signs of the End Times and the imminent return of Jesus Christ.

&gt;""The Bible says that whenever we approach the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ,"" Hagee explained, ""that there would be strange weather patterns. Jesus said this in Matthew the twenty-fifth chapter. So we have a decision to make: do we believe what an environmentalist group says and choose to live in a world where we're attempting to make everything as clean in the air as possible, or do we believe what the Bible says, that these things were going to happen and that rather than try to clean up all of the air and solve all of the problems of the world by eliminating factories, we should start to tell people about Jesus Christ who is to return?"":

&gt;On today’s edition of the “700 Club,” Robertson said actions to curb human-influenced climate change are part of an anti-American “socialist agenda,” saying it all goes back to “the playbook of Obama’s mentor.”

&gt;Fighting climate change “is high on the agenda of the radicals who want to destroy America, it isn’t high on the agenda of those who really care about what goes on in life,” he said.

&gt;“Environmentalism has become a religion,” Land says. “These are recycled communists, recycled socialists, recycled collectivists who are trying to use a flawed theory of environmentalism to bring about the collectivist society they were unable to bring about politically through socialism and through communism.”

&gt;Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe, also interviewed for the film, accuses environmentalists of “worshiping the environment” instead of God.

&gt;Truth In Action Ministries host John Rabe, meanwhile, warns that policies targeting climate change could lead to the return of communist dictatorships that left “over 100 million people killed.”

&gt;He also accuses scientists who are working on climate issues of having a “pretention to omniscience” and committing idolatry: “One of the ways we can commit idolatry is by substituting ourselves as the creature for God, that’s what many of these scientists and bureaucrats are trying to do.”

&gt;""In what has become one of the greatest deceptions of our day, radical environmentalism is striving to put America and the world under it's destructive control. 

&gt;This so called Green Dragon is seducing your children in our classrooms and popular culture. Its lust for political power now extends to the highest global levels. And its twisted view of the world elevates nature over the needs of people, even the poorest.

&gt;Son: ""It's only gone up 0.6 degrees""

&gt;Mother: ""Yeah it's not really a big problem is it""

&gt;Son: ""No. I don't think that it's gonna hurt us.""

&gt;Mother: ""It's a huuuge political issue, global warming is, and that's why it's really important for you to understand""

&gt;Son: ""Is evolution too?""

&gt;Mother: ""Not really""

&gt;Son: ""Creationism?""

&gt;Mother: ""It's becoming one. What if you had to go to a school where the teacher said ""creationism is stupid! And you're stupid if you believe that?""

&gt;Son: ""I think they should [unintelligible]""

&gt;Mother: ""Or, what if you had to go to a school where your teacher said ""Evolution is stupid, and you're stupid if you believe that?""

Some questions:  

1. What reasoning leads you to conclude that they are lying about agw, but not evolution?  
2. What do you believe agw means?  Some agw deniers have a mistaken understanding of what agw entails as a claim (i.e. *""humans are causing 100% of warming with no input from the sun""*) in the same way some creationists have a mistaken understanding of what evolution means (like that it includes abiogenesis or that it can happen to individual organisms within one generation)
3. Does your information come from research journals or blogs devoted to the denier/skeptic position on agw curated by unqualified individuals?

I recommend reading the following blog post by John Michael Greer:

http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2014/11/dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html

Here are some of the relevant portions:

&gt;Public trust in scientists has taken a beating for several other reasons as well. I’ve discussed in previous posts here the way that the vagaries of scientific opinion concerning climate change have been erased from our collective memory by one side in the current climate debate.  It’s probably necessary for me to reiterate here that I find the arguments for disastrous anthropogenic climate change far stronger than the arguments against it, and have discussed the likely consequences of our civilization’s maltreatment of the atmosphere repeatedly on this blog and in my books; the fact remains that in my teen years, in the 1970s and 1980s, scientific opinion was still sharply divided on the subject of future climates, and a significant number of experts believed that the descent into a new ice age was likely.
&gt;
&gt;I’ve taken the time to find and post here the covers of some of the books I read in those days. The authors were by no means nonentities. Nigel Calder was a highly respected science writer and media personality. E.C. Pielou is still one of the most respected Canadian ecologists, and the book of hers shown here, After the Ice Age, is a brilliant ecological study that deserves close attention from anyone interested in how ecosystems respond to sudden climatic warming. Windsor Chorlton, the author of Ice Ages, occupied a less exalted station in the food chain of science writers, but all the volumes in the Planet Earth series were written in consultation with acknowledged experts and summarized the state of the art in the earth sciences at the time of publication.
&gt;
&gt;Since certain science fiction writers have been among the most vitriolic figures denouncing those who remember the warnings of an imminent ice age, I’ve also posted covers of two of my favorite science fiction novels from those days, which were both set in an ice age future. My younger readers may not remember Robert Silverbergand Poul Anderson; those who do will know that both of them were serious SF writers who paid close attention to the scientific thought of their time, and wrote about futures defined by an ice age at the time when this was still a legitimate scientific extrapolation.
&gt;
&gt;These books exist.  I still own copies of most of them, and any of my readers who takes the time to find one will discover, in each nonfiction volume, a thoughtfully developed argument suggesting that the earth would soon descend into a new ice age, and in each of the novels, a lively story set in a future shaped by the new ice age in question. Those arguments turned out to be wrong, no question; they were made by qualified experts, at a time when the evidence concerning climate change was a good deal more equivocal than it’s become since that time, and the more complete evidence that was gathered later settled the matter; but the arguments and the books existed, many people alive today know that they existed, and when scientists associated with climate activism insist that they didn’t, the result is a body blow to public trust in science. 

You might want to consider that next time you say that there was ""one article"" talking about global cooling.  There were a great many scientists whose considered opinion was that a new glacial period was imminent.  It turns out they were wrong.  That's how science works.

&gt;Scientists Ask Why World Climate Is Changing; Major Cooling May Be Ahead

George Kulka is the only climate scientist there that expects cooling. THe rest of them seem to be undecided. 

&gt;you are going to try to minimize those somehow. 

Well, half of your links returned 404s. The other half doesn't even list the actual scientists, so:

1) I can't verify their names

2) I can't determine uniqueness; how do we know they're not the same scientists, i.e., the 70's equivalent of Roy Spencer.

I just find it puzzling that you cant' succinctly provide a list of climate scientists that predicted the climate would cool due to human activity. I mean *literally*, out of all of your last two posts, we've identified one concrete climate scientist who expected the Earth to cool. One.

There's an assembly line of unqualified, uneducated, presumptuous, hyper-confident and wholly inadequate armchair critics with misplaced confidence in their own intelligence and who feel compelled to spit venom at a researcher's life work.  Knock one down and the rest of them keep coming.  They rail on and on about fucking conspiracies like this is some kind of sick fourth grade playground charade.  You know what?  There is a debate.  It's about what exactly is happening and what we should do about it.  I'm willing to have this debate.  But the morons like /u/Kelly_jernigan, /u/DonnieS1, and /u/Florinator are a dime a dozen.  Not only do they have **no** fucking clue what they're talking about, they have the scientific literacy of a garden gnome.  And it's fucking exhausting, because I spent 7 years in a university setting learning the ins and outs of this stuff.  I wrote a master's thesis about it.  And every time one of those dumbshits opens their mouths, not only to they try to undermine an entire field of scientists, they claim it's some sort of malevolent power grab by nerds in white coats who want to tax them into poverty and keep Africa in electricity-free hell-holes.  These people are science nerds who do this kind of research in cold, dark labs for almost no money and **zero** fanfare.  They run numbers because they're fascinated by math, and they take their work very seriously.  None of these nitwits would even **think** about second-guessing an MD, or a PhD in astrophysics.  But a fucking *climate scientist*?  The claim is that they're not just wrong, they're **criminals**.  No, I'm tired of actually talking.  I'm tired of idiots who've never taken Chem101 telling me they know more than a team of PhDs.  And they know more than them because they read a fucking **blog post** like StephenGoddard or WattsUp.

Let me be straightforward.  There are some really piss-poor users in /r/environment, too.  Sometimes I call them out for bitching about population control because that's a corrosive non-starter.  Sometimes I try to stop the folks in /r/climate from touting a confidence level they can't claim.  But nothing wears me down as incredibly quickly as /r/climateskeptics.  It's a whole sub dedicated to flame wars about climatologists.  It's a sub dedicated not to even-handed discussion of evidence.  It's dedicated to climate-bashing.  I'm sorry you have to deal with sockpuppet assholes.  But you deserve some ire.  You rail on and on about assholes when they're ""alarmists"" (a pejorative term I fucking HATE), but you let /u/logicalprogressive spew condescension and blistering, hypercritical sarcasm.  And none of them ever gets so much as a ""hey now, let's be nice"".  No, to hell with that shit-storm.  I respect you, and I respect the fact that you really try to point out the conundrum of climate advocacy and simultaneous nuclear energy antipathy.  I think you know enough about peak oil to know that a post-carbon society is pretty critical, sooner or later.  But your sub is dedicated to armchair criticism of people's actual work.  The work people spent countless hours teasing out and analyzing.  And I don't have time to explain it all to every nincompoop who thinks he knows the capital 'T' Truth.  If they can't read an actual article before they make up their mind, they're lost from the get-go, and there are enough echo chambers out there for every moron to reinforce their cognitive bias until the cows come home.  Good luck with that.  Just don't pretend that you hold some sort of moral high ground.  You're part of that conversation.  And if anything else, the fact that you actually *know* what you're talking about gives you *more* responsibility to get the know-nothings to tone it the fuck down.  And here /u/Kid-Quantum is, turning /r/climatescience into /r/climateskepticslite.  No, thanks.  Call him out for posting non-science for ""gotcha"" points or acknowledge that you're just like the rest of them.

I'm exhausted.  Some people can't be saved.  I won't do it.  But I sure will meet them, fire with fire, when they come spouting nonsense about what they *think* they know.  Because I'm one of those researchers, and how fucking **dare** they.

Now you know why I'm mad.  Sorry it was laced with profanity.  Hope you don't interpret that as me ""not being able to discuss climate change in a civil manner"".

"1326","cntjneo","0","0","t1_cntfab1","Firstly, and I mean this, thanks for sharing.  I think opening up like you have isn't always easy, but hopefully it will help to build a bridge.  To that end, allow me to reciprocate.  (BTW, I would never ban you for an honest response to a question.)  

My background is rather varied, as you may have gathered.  My interest in climate change started back before I found reddit over five years ago.  At the time, I frequented slashdot.org, and I made a journal entry even then about just how difficult it was to have any discussion on the topic because of all the screaming over the issue.

I already had a little knowledge of climate change when *An Inconvenient Truth* came out.  I decided I needed to learn more about the topic since it was clear that policy would be affected by it.  I found that Gore had over-egged the pudding, as it were.  This caused me to swing from a position of alarm to skepticism.  Still, I kept researching and eventually concluded that the position I found most consistent with the evidence was ""lukewarmer.""  What's fascinating with taking that position is the hate that rains down on one from the radicals on both poles, though much more from the climate activist end.

Now I'm going to suggest something here, and I don't mean to offend.  It's about the friends we choose to keep.  After *An Inconvenient Truth* came out, but before I did much research, I heard some people disputing the film and very quickly picked up on the fact that they were associated with oil companies.  I wrote them off immediately, because their motivation was clear.  It was easy to tune them out and listen to the more concerned voices.  Later, when I found some problems with the film, I experienced a flip and found myself fully repulsed by some of the people screaming the loudest about how climate change was an existential threat to life on earth.  It was ironic, because some of those people were the most despicable misanthropes you'll ever encounter, referring to humanity as a cancer that needs eradication and whatnot.

So here is what I'm going to suggest.  It's easy to empathize with people supporting your side of the debate.  That means it's easy to gloss over their mistakes and cheer when they get it right.  As angry as you are at people like those you named, there are people every bit as angry at people like /u/GTChessplayer, /u/Actuallynot, /u/FormerlyTurnipHugger, the various incarnations of /u/outspokenskeptic, /u/StonerMeditation, etc.  The crazy thing is that people are angry at them for the same reason you are angry: for rejecting what science actually says.  Every one of your criticisms (scientific literacy of a garden gnome, spewing condescension and sarcasm, posting non-science and ""gotcha"" points) can be leveled at those you consider friends.

Now you are mad at me for not stepping in and calling out false statements from one side of the debate.  I understand that.  Can you understand that if I called out non-science I would have to remove or comment on most everything posted here?

Let me illustrate a bit more.  The other day /u/Kid-Quantum pointed out that some scientists in 60s and 70s were warning of imminent global cooling.  Some people said he was lying.  I brought in some evidence to support his claim, because there actually were scientists who felt that cooling, perhaps even glaciation, was imminent.  I never once stated that there was a consensus around that idea, but how do you suppose my statements were interpreted?  Moreover, does it even matter what scientists from that era thought?  Good scientists change their minds in the face of evidence, and that's what happened.  The correct, rational response to /u/Kid-Quantum's post should have been, ""Yes, some scientists did believe that.  They changed their minds.""  Instead, there were vitriolic and demonstrably false claims that no scientists ever believed such a thing, that it was all a fiction invented by the media.

I've observed, online and in meat space, that when people are emotional, they lose their ability to reason.  I get that you are angry, because I've been there far too many times.  Can you really tell me that when you feel angry you are at your intellectual best?

When I created this subreddit five years ago, the intent was to try to do the seemingly impossible: have a rational discussion about one of the most divisive topics around.  I don't know how to do that if I start censoring people based on their opinion.  (I'll mention here that I've banned people for an inability to play nicely, and I'll do it again, but that is about behavior, not belief.)  I welcome your suggestions.  I mean that.

Might I offer one bit of friendly advice?  Read through posts from /u/nimbuscile.  He's a climate scientist in the UK, and I have a deep respect for the guy for the way he handles himself.  (He actually got called a ""denier"" the other day over in /r/climate.)  He picks his battles.  He refrains from attacks.  He keeps his cool.  I'm not saying you have to behave just like him, just that he displays the kind of behavior that leads to discussion.  If you keep meeting fire with fire, I think you will burn yourself out.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2sene4",1421643542,2015-01-19 04:59:02,"Will_Power"

And it belies the hypocrisy of that whole ""i got banned from /r/climate, apparently it really **IS** a religion"" nonsense.  Both sides are echo chambers full of self-congratulatory nobodies.  And that goes back to my comment about claiming any sort of moral high ground.  Don't claim [you don't like assholes](http://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/2rcaav/rclimateskeptics_has_a_pretty_strong_ban_hammer/cnf7iy2) and then turn a blind eye to assholery.

Now, as for **you** being angry, perhaps I should reiterate the point I made earlier...

I'm a scientist.  I spent 7 years in a university setting taking higher level courses from some of the best professors in their fields.  I had to write papers that defended a position using reputable sources and credible evidence.  I had to answer to people who were smarter and knew more than me.  If I bullshitted or took something out of context, I failed.  And after all of that training, I've come to accept evidence where it is present, and uncertainty where it is not.  I wrote a thesis that had to be vetted before acceptance by the university.  I find it more than a little disheartening that you began (or perhaps crystallized) your perspective in this discussion based on the claims of a movie (and one designed for mass consumption, at that).  I have no doubt you're educated, and perhaps very smart.  But I defer to scientists who know better than me.  And I've spoken to dozens of them.  I've been to conferences on multiple continents.  I've heard lectures.  I know there's an established set of facts that underpin a consensus that action to address risk is prudent.  What those people in /r/climateskeptics are saying isn't just infantile, it's **anti-science**.  It's literally and contemptuously undermining an entire field of knowledge.  They wave a pseudo-banner of scientific integrity while they condemn an entire piece of our empirically-verified existence.  This, despite the fact that entire organizations of chemists, geologists, biologists, ecologists, physicists, meteorologists, and their peers have roundly criticized the ""skeptical"" position as lacking any academic rigor or internal consistency (note: not as pertains to particulars...as pertains to things like ""climategate"" and flim flam about natural cycles).  Like I said, they wouldn't even *think* about looking at a cancer doctor and saying ""yeah, well, your instruments haven't been calibrated and you don't have a long enough timeline to link my smoking directly to a tumor"".  No, they wouldn't do that because the cancer doctor knows **WAY** more about this stuff than they do.  He's been trained and went through years of blood, sweat, and tears coming to the point where a few letters in front of his name indicate that he should be trusted, because he's been vetted.  When he tells you to stop smoking or it'll kill you, you stop smoking.  If you walked into his office and started berating him as incompetent because of what you read on some homeopath blog, he'd get fucking **mad**.  And he'd be right to.  Not because the two of you *disagree*.  Because you're attempting to undermine *his entire expertise as a medical professional*.  But then for you to get mad that he got mad at you in the first place wouldn't just be ironic.  It'd be the very definition of tragic comedy.

So now, I offer you this.  You can claim to be a ""lukewarmer"" all you want, and perhaps your appeal to moderation leads you to believe that the midpoint between two extreme thought patterns is more likely the truth, but at a certain point you have to acknowledge that evidence exists, that hundreds and thousands of very intelligent people have agreed that it is telling us something, and that your self-professed ""minority view"" might not actually be a competing intellectual camp at all.  It might just be the very *antithesis* of knowledge.  It might be that people have every reason to be mad at you because your group is selectively disparaging trained professionals as having ulterior motives and being primarily fueled by short-sighted self interest.  If the fact that someone on /r/climate hyperbolizes a headline to claim the extinction of the human race is imminent gets you blazing mad, then sure.  Go right ahead.  Get mad.  They lack evidence for that claim.  But you cannot get mad that someone's evidence doesn't disagree with yours.  I don't get mad when someone's evidence disagrees with mine.  When I **do** get mad is when someone waltzes into a conversation with *nothing*, shits on the chess board, throws around some misdirectional drivel, misinterprets the works of well-respected researchers, and then flies away in a kind of pompous show of gratuitous incompetence.  I don't get mad that we're not acting on climate change.  I don't think an adequate response to this crisis is likely in the next 20 years, until it's far too late to actually do anything about it.  And I don't lose sleep over it, because a lot of that is just the inertia of human systems.   But I do get mad that we're having the same stupid conversation over and over and over, because there's no shortage of uneducated morons who take a bite of the pie and use it to fill in a narrative they'd already uncritically adopted.  If you have a parallel that gets you mad, then fine.  Get mad.  But don't assume equivalence where there is none.  One side is backed by 30 years of professional research and virtually all of the professional scientific organizations in the world.  The other has a voice that's been getting smaller and smaller every year, but that gets louder and louder in its claims of oppression.  In the end, knowledge trumps ignorance.  If you argue from a position of knowledge, and back up your claims, and someone argues from ignorance and backs up nothing, please get mad.  Point me to them and I'll get them, too.  If you don't, then please don't assume the two are one in the same.  For they are not.  Not in the slightest.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2sene4",1421780989,2015-01-20 19:09:49,"plathtic_thong"

First, traitor implies someone who has changed sides.  Second, they didn't operate under the assumption until he decided to disparage the whole sub.  Guess who did a lot of that?  

&gt;Both sides are echo chambers full of self-congratulatory nobodies. 

There we go then.  You are mad at me for not diving in over there when I've focused my efforts of late on this sub with the intent of bridge building.

&gt;perhaps I should reiterate the point I made earlier...

I'm happy to read it again, but be assured, I understood you the first time.

&gt;I find it more than a little disheartening that you began (or perhaps crystallized) your perspective in this discussion based on the claims of a movie (and one designed for mass consumption, at that).

You'll recall that I said the movie initially cause me concern, which it was intended to so.  I was very clear that it was a *starting* point for me, not an end, so you are quite incorrect to even imply that it ""crystallized"" my position.

&gt; I have no doubt you're educated, and perhaps very smart. 

I am educated, particularly in math and statistics, but a few other fields as well.  I would like to think I'm smart, but there's something here I hope you can acknowledge.  There are lots of very smart people who have reached diametrically opposed conclusions in pretty much any field you care to name.

&gt;But I defer to scientists who know better than me. And I've spoken to dozens of them.

This is where we diverge somewhat.  If someone knows better than me, I seek to learn what they know.  I've conversed with lots of very smart people in the climate world as well, including Gavin Schmidt.  I recognize that they are all unified on the basics, but that there is a wide range of opinion on the more nuanced details of the subject.

&gt;I know there's an established set of facts that underpin a consensus that action to address risk is prudent. 

Have you ever heard me argue otherwise?  What seems to really get under the skin of the more hand-wringy types is that I dare disagree with them on *what* action is prudent.  You know very well that there are a good number of people screaming, with spittle and everything, that **the** solution is a carbon tax that will fund only solar and wind and a $100 billion annual fund to pay reparations to poor countries.  I know you've encountered them, because I have, and I'm sure you've talked to far more people of that ilk than I have.

&gt; What those people in /r/climateskeptics are saying isn't just infantile, it's anti-science.

OK.  Is it any more anti-science than the screamers that claim to be pro-science that continually lie, lie, lie about what the science *actually* says?  The ones who claim that melting permafrost will release so much methane that the sky will literally catch on fire?  The ones who claim 4.5°C warming by 2050 *as just barely happened in /r/climate*?  The ones claiming humanity becoming extinct within 100 years unless we do this or that?  Come on.  If you are pissed at people denying the science on one side, why aren't you pissed at the science deniers on the other side?  I would sincerely appreciate an answer to that.

&gt;If you walked into his office and started berating him as incompetent because of what you read on some homeopath blog, he'd get fucking mad. And he'd be right to.

Since you've opted to argue from analogy, let's do so.  If I asked my doctor for the data behind a paper he just had published and he refused to provide it to me, would you trust that doctor?  Of course you wouldn't.  There are some bad apples among climate scientists, but instead of calling them out, the collective has either turned a blind eye to the problem *or actually rallied around the bad apples*.  That gives critics loads of ammunition, as it should.  There's no place in science for people that can't act like scientists.  You and your peers should have kicked the few bad actors to the curb, but you didn't.  You actually defended those assholes, and you are paying a price in public opinion for it.  Until you do that, you might check your rage at people who have good reason to feel distrustful.

&gt;...but at a certain point you have to acknowledge that evidence exists...

Goddammit, now you are starting to piss *me* off.  I dare you to find a single comment or post of mine where I **do not** acknowledge the evidence that exists.  I'm happy to extend this olive branch for as long as you would like to carry on this conversation, but I will not tolerate accusations about my own character that you can't back up.

If you would listen to what I'm saying, you would understand that I acknowledge very plainly that lots of climate scientists see a risk and have recommended action.  I am *for* action.  I am just not for stupid action.  So you might want to calm the fuck down for a second before you ruin the goodwill I thought we were both working toward.

&gt;It might be that people have every reason to be mad at you because your group is selectively disparaging trained professionals...

*My group*?  Show me the lukewarmers that are doing this.  But if you want to talk about ""selectively disparaging trained professionals,"" where are your defenses of John Christy?  How about Roy Spencer?  Judith Curry?  Dare I say, Dick Lindzen?  Yeah, you are pissed, but your indignation is hollow if you are unwilling to defend professionals who disagree with you.

&gt;If the fact that someone on /r/climate hyperbolizes a headline to claim the extinction of the human race is imminent gets you blazing mad, then sure. Go right ahead. Get mad. 

But here's the thing.  I *don't* get mad.  I roll my eyes in their general direction.  Did you not read my comment earlier?  Getting mad results in nothing more than emotional responses, generally insults.  What does that accomplish?  Not a damn thing.

&gt;When I do get mad is when someone waltzes into a conversation with nothing, shits on the chess board, throws around some misdirectional drivel, misinterprets the works of well-respected researchers, and then flies away in a kind of pompous show of gratuitous incompetence.

You've just described the person at /r/climate with the hyperbolic headline.  They have no more evidence of that claim than does an actual climate denier who says that CO2 is not a greenhouse gas.  Have you gotten **mad** at that person?  I haven't seen you respond to any such claim, but they are denying the science every bit as much.

&gt;But I do get mad that we're having the same stupid conversation over and over and over, because there's no shortage of uneducated morons who take a bite of the pie and use it to fill in a narrative they'd already uncritically adopted.

I'm with you there.  The difference is that you see it on one side of the argument, while I see it on both.  You can't tell me, after the rant you've just provided, that you aren't.

&gt;But don't assume equivalence where there is none. 

A person claiming extinction of humanity from CO2 emissions *is* equivalent in his or her ignorance to the person claiming the CO2 is not a greenhouse gas.  You really seem to have a hard time seeing what those who are cheering behind you are actually saying.  Please, and I am begging this of you, please look at what your supporters are saying.  Ask yourself how much their hyperbole, or even actual misguided beliefs about what the science says, is damaging your efforts.

&gt;One side is backed by 30 years of professional research and virtually all of the professional scientific organizations in the world.

See how you frame it?  You frame it as climate scientists against the evil deniers.  Consider that it is actually climate scientists, ""deniers"" if you like the term, and alarmists that are declaring the Apocalypse, falsely, in the name of science.  Both of the latter groups are as anti-science as can be, but you really don't seem to see the damage that the alarmists are causing.

&gt;If you argue from a position of knowledge, and back up your claims, and someone argues from ignorance and backs up nothing, please get mad.   Point me to them and I'll get them, too. 

I refuse to get mad at ignorance, but you want a fine example, look at my most recent comments in /r/climate.

&gt; If you don't, then please don't assume the two are one in the same. For they are not. Not in the slightest.

I'm truly baffled that you can't see what the alarmists are saying.  Truly.  I do think it is because you view them as helping you get your message out.  Kind of an ends-justify-the-means kind of thing, but I plead with you to consider that accepting them as allies only harms you and what you would like to say in the end.

Also, I had a tussle with /u/GTChessplayer about a week ago about this 2014 hottest year kerfuffle.  He's an obstinate one, that guy.  I tried to get him to stop claiming that 2014 is the hottest year we've ever measured in the history of Earth, simply because our record only goes back as far as 1880, but it fell on deaf ears.  In the end, he tried so hard to argue semantics that my message was lost in the fray.

And as I mentioned before, I've confronted users who talk about the extinction of the species on multiple occasions (this is an alt account, in case it's not obvious by now).  I've called them out for hyperbole.  I've consistently downvoted comments that talk about an unreasonably high ECS, and I've upvoted a lot of your recent posts.  I've discussed the virtues of cap and trade vs. carbon taxing *at length* with people who take the default position that a carbon tax is the answer.  I hope you understand that my malice isn't wholly directed at one camp.  It's simply magnified by users who are quite literally stupid.  Not just wrong, or misled.  They are stupid.  Read a few of /u/DonnieS1's posts.  Or /u/dullly.  Read /u/Florinator's recent banning from /r/EverythingScience.  He was fairly even-handed at first, but when he was banned he ran to /r/climateskeptics and started flouting actual science for the sake of harebrained, crackpot rhetorical nonsense.  I've upvoted /u/bligh8 a few times, but his comments recently are *really* over the top.  So much so that most of the time I can't tell what he's actually talking about.  That comment in /r/climate you're talking about that has a 4.5C by 2050?  1 upvote.  Your response?  Three.  As long as the space is actually modded (maybe /u/silence7 will stick around this time), I think you'll find that most of us are as critical of nonsense on both sides.  The science is plain, boring, and tedious.  It's not hyperbolic or emotive.  Mass media is the opposite.  Despite obvious click-bait headlines, I try to call people out when they need to be called out.  And when logic comes from the ""skeptical"" side, I give credit where credit is due.  /u/climate_control seems fairly rational, despite the fact that he created a unique account for a specific purpose and seems to be sticking very faithfully to that singular mission.  You and /u/TheFerretman are, too.  You both have expertise that lends you credibility, and you speak (type?) plainly.  /u/logicalprogressive contributes nothing but withering criticism.

The point of all this is to say that I'm more even-handed than you think.  ""Alarmists"" get away with almost any kind of evidence-less claim in /r/climate because it's a virtually un-modded space.  /u/silence7 might as well not even be there, so there's no one to check the hatefulness and hyperbole.  We can have a conversation about that, but it won't really do either of us any good, as that space is what it is.  But you **do** mod /r/climateskeptics, so I'm opening up to someone who could actually do something about it.  Users in /r/science are usually pretty good about burying comments that assert some nonsense about the skies literally catching fire.  And it looks like /r/climate has the potential to sort itself out, too.  /r/environment is still full of a bunch of nutjobs, but that's for another conversation (well intentioned or not, they're fucking nuts).  I downvoted the shit out of the lot of them and eventually un-subscribed.  If a mod of /r/environment asks me if I want to talk, then I'll be able to have this conversation with them.  But for now, they haven't, and I'm not.  My wife is going to sleep without me, so I have to cut this one short.  I'll probably think of something else I want to say tomorrow.

There is nothing wrong with NASA and NOAA's claim. The fact remains that 2014 is the best candidate for warmest year on record. A lot is made of the error margins, but you have to remember that every year has those margins. In the case of 2014, it just so happens that the average, minimum and maximum value are higher than the corresponding average, minimum and maximum values for 2005 and 2010. Theferore, 2014 is the best candidate for warmest year.

Put yet another way: if you had to bet money on which year is the warmest on record, you'd be a fool to bet on any other year than 2014.

&gt;There is nothing wrong with trying to determine the extent and potential causes of any changes.

Agreed.

&gt; However this is not what is being done.

The point of science is to determine causes and effects. That is what is being done. How could anyone possibly say that all of the many research institutions in the world focused on climate and climate change aren't doing... science?

&gt; The consistent cries all blame CO2 emissions

That is because the results of the thousands of experiments, observations, and data collections all point to Carbon emissions being the primary factor in global climate change. In other words, science.

&gt; All the hysteria or crying ""wolf"" does...

Hysteria, noun: ""exaggerated or uncontrollable emotion or excitement."" Science does not operate on emotion or excitement. It operates on observation, empirical data, and analysis. Any scientist knows that accounting for possible bias is an incredibly important part of any experiment. The only 'hysteria' flying around is that of climate deniers, who make non-scientific arguments and yell about the 'climate conspiracy' on cable news shows.

&gt;  ...is cloud any reasoned scientific analysis and distorts facts for the benefit of a few.

There is an overwhelmingly huge body of reasoned scientific analysis. It just all happens to support the hypothesis that climate change is real and is being caused by humans and it's a serious threat. No climate deniers have yet been able to provide solid, scientific evidence to oppose that principle.

As for ""distorting the facts for the benefit of a few,"" who the hell is benefiting? Underpaid research scientists &amp; PHD candidates? Any scientist could make way more money working for an oil company. In fact, there have been many instances in the past when oil companies offered scientists large sums of money to publicly speak against climate change. If the scientists were working for profit over truth, they would've switched the side of oil and coal companies long ago.

&gt; Who made money from Al Gores film?

Al Gore did. Then he donated every cent of it to form a bipartisan educational campaign. But just because someone profits off something doesn't make it untrue. There are tens of thousands of scientists world-wide who work for not much money. Guess who profits from advocating that climate change isn't real? Oil, gas, and coal companies, and they make way way way more than any scientific organization.

&gt; I hope it is not too much for people to actually read and question the ""evidence"" before passing judgement.

Again, the evidence is abundant and it's very clear. There have been over 12,000 papers since 1991 published in peer reviewed journals that support the hypothesis that anthropogenic climate change is real. By contrast, there were 11 papers that claimed the opposite. So who is really passing judgement before reading the evidence?

Unless it's a concerted effort by all mods to do some gentle nudging like, ""do you have a source for that?"" or something else benign at first, I suspect it'll be a) too much for you to take on singlehandedly and b) enough to start a riot.  Suffice to say you've got me thinking enough to have some empathy, so it comes with minor satisfaction that I know you're actually being level-headed about it.  Maybe that's what matters.  If it were a more reckless, hands-off approach, I'd be more perturbed.  It isn't, and for that I thank you.  

If anything, moving past the ""it's all a liberal power grab"" and ""scientists are conspiring"" stage would be a positive sign.  Things like climategate and the falsification of the hockey stick don't do anything but stoke old fires.  If more people focused on ECS and model assumptions rather than ""all models have been wrong **every time forever**"", then the discussion could actually start hammering down the uncertainties that *do* warrant attention.  Do comment reports help?  I don't want to muddy the waters if they don't, but maybe they're a good way to target particularly baseless accusations (from both sides).  

I'd like to note that you actually did get me thinking.  The comment about Curry, Lindzen, et al actually struck a chord, and I thought about it a lot yesterday.  Scientist-bashing *does* happen on both sides, and in both cases it's equally warrantless.  I went into a /r/climate thread about Keystone XL a few minutes ago, ready to pounce on someone who said something about it ""sending the earth's climate over the edge"", which is ridiculous.  But I did find [this](http://www.sei-international.org/publications?pid=2450), [this](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2014/01/31/keystone-pipeline-will-impact-climate-change-state-department-reports/), and [this](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n9/full/nclimate2335.html), so I held off.  I also read James Hansen's opinion piece [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/opinion/game-over-for-the-climate.html?_r=0), which seems **really** over the top apocalyptic, given the mild manner of the other reports on what Keystone XL will or won't do.  I suppose his conclusion rests on the assumption that Keystone XL will trigger ""full exploitation"" of tar sands, which seems like quite a logical leap.  Still, I think I'll collect more information before I throw my hat in on that one.

I'd also like to see more discussion about the limitations of fossil fuel peaks on long-term GHG forecasts.  That's something you've talked about that I don't think gets enough airplay.  I think it's messy enough when we actually try to start forecasting economically-viable fossil fuels from hitherto unknown and unproven reserves, but I think it's a worthy debate.  Still, I think it points to a post-carbon future which will be easier with long-term and phased in structural adjustments than it will be when diminishing returns starts to inexorably squeeze GDP growth.  We can push back the diminishing part, but only temporarily.

Also, for what it's worth, I think a carbon tax is a bad idea.  Not just politically unpalatable.  Altogether bad.

The downside to reporting comments is that it cuts both ways.  /u/formerlyturniphugger's insistence on putting scare quotes around the word ""skeptic"" every time he uses the word is just as offensive to some as the kinds of comments we are discussing.

Pop quiz: which is uglier? [A](http://imgur.com/a/DsK5W) or [B](http://imgur.com/a/KPJnY)? I live about 3 miles away from a wind farm and I can see them out my window. My uncle lives a couple miles away from an oil refinery. When it comes to who has a better view, there's no contest.  Now the bird-killing thing is an issue that needs to be better addressed. But the overall environmental impact of wind farms is nothing compared to the devastation caused by oil refineries, spills, chemicals, etc. 82,000 birds (just birds) were harmed or killed in the Deepwater Horizon spill alone. And that's just one of many environmental disasters caused by the fossil fuel process.

&gt; hapless native peoples have been expelled from their from ancestral lands

I did quite a bit of digging on this. Nowhere could I find a record of native people being displaced due to renewable energy initiatives. Quite the opposite. There's a long history of Tribal lands being taken over by coal and oil companies and native peoples suffering serious health effects from coal and oil plants installed on or near tribal land. Look up the Bakken formation and the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara nations. The Turtle Mountain tribe of Chippewa in North Dakota had to ban fracking on their land.

By contrast, the Rosebud Sioux tribe built a huge wind turbine on their land (controlled and owned by them) that earns them $2,000-$4,000 a month.

&gt; fraud in the trading of carbon credits has cheated honest taxpayers.

True. Mostly the big thing in Britain. But there are also dozens of other countries for whom carbon credits or cap&amp;trade systems have worked very well. Besides, there's plenty of fraud in the major US banks, does that mean we should just shut down that whole system?

&gt; Policies to ‘stop climate change’ are based on climate models that completely failed to predict the lack of warming for the past two decades.

This is just incorrect. There has been warming for the past decade. But even if their wasn't warming, it's the long term trend that matters. Also note how this author never cites his sources...

&gt;Observational data show clearly that the predictions of unacceptable warming by more carbon dioxide are wrong.

The entire European cap and trade system is pretty corrupt.  What system did you have in mind?

&gt;while an intermittent producer might produce power when it's generally more valuable.

Banks can be shut down or fined for corruption.  Is that true of cap and trade manipulation?

I think ""lack of warming"" wasn't intended as ""no warming.""  If I throw a party expecting 100 people, but 20 show up, I could very well say that I won't throw another one because of the lack of people at the last one.

And this position is fundamentally antithetical to a search for truth.  The point isn't that these scientists are angels.  The point is that they communicated like humans tend to communicate in every other sector of private life, and that to harp on it as evidence of some kind of criminal consipiracy (i.e. ""STILL being tricked"") is wholly disingenuous.

If you ask for a citation that clarifies whether the criticism levied at scientists is valid, then independent panels of professionals are adequate for that purpose.  All of this catches attention in huge, glaring sound bytes (i.e. FTA: "" the statistician who exposed the computer trickery behind that famous “hockey stick” graph""), but when you sit down and look at it plainly and without getting all bent out of shape, you realize that not only do these ""tricks"" not constitute anything even remotely resembling malpractice, but they're also shared by researchers all over the world in their need to process and digest data, not to mention the fact that the hockey stick has been confirmed in something like 8 different peer-reviewed publications in recent years.

Two thoughts on this:

- There's a pretty good argument that at least some of the panels were not providing the dispassionate eye you assume.  In the case of one, Phil Jones was asked who he would like on the committee.

- The panels actually **did** find evidence of wrongdoing, just not fraud.  They found that FOIA requests had been ignored.  They criticized the accused for not seeking review from qualified statisticians.  They were very critical of the accused for not publishing data and source code.  The climategate emails and those review committees are large parts of the reasons that data and source code are available today where they weren't as available in the past.

If someone pokes around asking for all of my work to be made public, especially during a time when I'm trying desperately to stay at the cutting edge of my field and ensure that some no-name Chinese journal doesn't shoehorn my data into a publication before I've had a chance to vet the idea, then I'm going to do my best to avoid having to disclose this sensitive information (**especially** if I think someone's asking to try to discredit me out of spite).  The success or failure of my career hinges on my ability to produce novel work.  Also, I have no reason why they didn't seek out qualified statisticians to review their work.  Perhaps they considered it moot in that they had other researchers with experience in statistical analysis who'd already given them feedback.  This, to me, doesn't constitute ""wrongdoing"".  It constitutes a simple failure to quadruple-check your work.  It happens.  Does any of that excuse ignoring FOIA requests?  Probably not.  Does either situation mean they were intentionally misleading with falsified data?  Unambiguously, no.  So it does little to undermine the actual *science*.  It just pointed to a hole in the *process* which has since been remedied.  The system isn't perfect, nor are the individuals, but they didn't do anything to **trick** anyone.  They simply held their cards too close to their chests and were called out for it.  The science didn't actually change.  The inquiries didn't result in any retracted papers or overturned conclusions, just some protocol changes and adjustments in internal communication quality control and transparency.  I suppose you can call for inquiries into the inquiries if you're **really** dissatisfied, but at a certain point (maybe after 8 reviews?) I think one has to accept that the evidence isn't as damning as it seems to the untrained observer.  

I offer you this...if Judith Curry had some nasty emails leaked that indicated she'd avoided a FOIA request from a hyper-partisan climate change advocacy group and also indicated that she talked disparagingly about other climate scientists and discussed informal ""adjustments"" to her data, don't you think there would be calls for temperance from folks on the other side of the issue?  Don't you think it'd be met with a resounding, ""Yeah, ok, but this is all *ad hominem*, and the **science** is still sound!""

I think it would.  And I see no reason not to extend the same courtesy to Phil Jones.  He was kind of a dick about it, sure.  But the scientific consensus doesn't rest on the laurels of one man, so even if he were a lying, cheating crook, very little would change.

Using weather stations in nearby countries introduces a great deal of statistical uncertainty, and I think the issue some people take with the practice of ex post facto adjustments is that that increase in uncertainty rarely makes the news release.

Steirou and Koutsoyiannis looked at the results of homogenization in their 2012 paper.  I don't have the full paper, but here is the abstract:

https://www.itia.ntua.gr/getfile/1212/2/documents/EGU2012-956-1.pdf

They note that warming is the result of homogenization in about 2/3rds of the stations they examines, where it should result in warming 50% of the time.  From the abstract:

""It was found that in the two thirds of the cases, the homogenization procedure
increased the positive or decreased the negative temperature trends.

""One of the most common homogenization methods, ‘SNHT for single shifts’, was applied to synthetic time series with selected statistical characteristics, occasionally with offsets. The method was satisfactory when applied to independent data normally distributed, but not in data with long-term persistence.

""The above results cast some doubts in the use of homogenization procedures and tend to indicate that the global temperature increase during the last century is between 0.4◦C and 0.7◦C, where these two values are the estimates derived from raw and adjusted data, respectively.

At the end of the video, the presenter asks why Booker would believe NOAA would adjust the temperatures data by about 3%.  I guess he didn't note that Booker was quite clear in that 2014 probably wouldn't have claimed the title as ""Hottest Year Evah!"" without that Paraguayan adjustment.

In this case, the author fails to understand several concept. Well really, all of the concepts, but here are two main ones:

- Climate change in no way suggests that winters in New England will always be warmer. If that were the case, ""global warming"" would be the correct term rather than Global Climate Change. Climate Scientists have always been very clear that climate change is caused by an overall rise in global temperatures, but one of the primary *results* of climate change is a trend toward more extreme fluctuations in weather. Higher highs and lower lows.

- Climate change is global, not local. Sure, the Northeast is having an incredibly cold winter. But the American Northeast is an incredibly small portion of the planet. Last year, the U.S. also saw an incredibly cold winter, but globally it was the 8th warmest on record.  America, small parts of Russia, and some of Southwest Asia saw colder than normal temperatures. Literally everywhere else on earth saw warming. If poverty rates in America drop, does that mean global poverty is being cured? of course not.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2tuew8",1422375201,2015-01-27 16:13:21,"forrey"

Also note that while Northeastern winters have gotten much warmer over the past 40 years, they've also gotten much wetter, with extreme precipitation in the region increase some 67%. This change is likely due to natural variability rather than climate change (for reasons I won't go into here), but means you're more likely to see heavy snowfalls. 

Snow is a threshold-driven process. If it's 20F out and there's precipitation, it'll be snow. If it's 24F out there'll still be snow.

It's also worth noting that the [IPCC predicted](http://www.bbc.co.uk/climate/impact/gulf_stream.shtml) long ago that due to the effect of climate change on the gulf stream, areas near the gulf stream (aka the American Northeast) might experience a degree of cooling in the winters.

Somehow you're doing some wacky math.

And because I'm using a fitted trendline it's not particularly sensitive to individual years. But that's fine, we can do it your way - We'll start with December 1959 - February 1960, tied for the 20th warmest winters in the 119 year record you posted, and at 26.3 F a full 3 degrees warmer than the long term average. You'll find that the trendline is then +0.8 F/Decade, which leads to a warming since 1960 of 4.32F.

I've already refuted your cherrypicking claim by going to 1960, which was warmer than usual. These fits are not that sensitive to the end dates. In terms of the recent downward trend, that may be true (although the downward trend is not statistically significant at all; the 95% confidence bounds for a linear fit over those 20 years range from -2.3 to +1.9 F per decade), but it in no way refutes my earlier claim. The problem is to find a downward trend you have to necessarily pick shorter time scales which are by their nature going to have higher uncertainty. Understanding the influence of shorter term variability including drivers like the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation is necessary to select an appropriate timescale for analysis. 

More to the point, your claim (or more to the point, Goddard's claim) is that the snow in the northeast is evidence that it's not getting warmer.

Your statement that temperatures rose ~4F is untrue.  You keep attempting to apply a cherrypicked trend line to a cherrypicked start date instead of looking at the actual temperature values.

This is not how statistics work. You don't compare two dates, you fit a least-squares regression to *all* the data. This fit is not any more sensitive to the start and end dates than it is to any other datapoint in the series. I made this clear by ""cherrypicking"" 1960, an warmer than average year, and found very nearly the same trend. You haven't commented on that, probably because it doesn't fit your narrative. 

You keep arguing that what I say isn't valid because it's not true (it is) and then argue that the fact that it's true doesn't matter because I cherrypicked (I didn't). You don't seem to complain that I've picked a colder than average year to end my analysis, I wonder why that is. 

But hey, let's start with a warmer than average year - let's say 1974-1975, which is 3 degrees above the base period, and end with a colder than average year, say 2013-2014 which is 1.1 degrees cooler than the base period. I'm now cherrypicking in the way you'd like me to here, correct? 

The results? [an upward temperature trend of 0.9F per decade.](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/us/101/00/tavg/3/02/1895-2014?base_prd=true&amp;firstbaseyear=1901&amp;lastbaseyear=2000&amp;trend=true&amp;trend_base=10&amp;firsttrendyear=1970&amp;lasttrendyear=2014) 

You can say that temperatures have dropped since 2005  ([though not by 1.2F, rather by 0.8F](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/us/101/00/tavg/3/02/1895-2014?base_prd=true&amp;firstbaseyear=1901&amp;lastbaseyear=2000&amp;trend=true&amp;trend_base=10&amp;firsttrendyear=1970&amp;lasttrendyear=2014)) if you want, that doesn't change the truth of my original statement (""outlandish"") and if you do a basic uncertainty analysis on a trend over 10 data points you'll find that that supposed trend is nowhere near statistically significant. The only way to get the results you want is to pick time scales that are much too short to give meaningful results. That's not cherrypicking or intellectual dishonesty, that's just basic statistics.

&gt; Yet you don't even attempt to use all the data and continue to cherrypick start dates. The NOAA data is available from 1895 with a decadal trend of +0.3 yet you seem unwilling or unable to use it.

[I have cited the trend over all the data.](http://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/2tuew8/shock_news_it_snows_when_it_is_cold/co2ntsj) I also made a factual claim of a change since 1970; one you called ""outlandish"" (in your now-edited comment) and one you suggested meant I was smoking something (in your now-edited comment). You seem to think this claim is untrue, even though it's made using the same data and methodology you tacitly endorse. You even went so far as to write a whole comment about how I was reading the trendlines wrong, one you deleted when (I assume) you realized it was you who was reading the trendlines wrong.

The choice of 1970 is not arbitrary. During the first half of the century CO2 levels had not yet begun to rise steeply, so including that period in the trend would lead to an underestimation of the rate of increase. The steep rise in CO^2 levels [begins around 1960](http://www.eoearth.org/files/145501_145600/145561/co2_eoe_atmosphere.jpg). Had I simply wanted to cherrypick I would have included much the of the 1960s, when temperatures were suppressed in part by the eruption of [Mount Agung](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Agung). The key is to pick a timescale that (1) isolates the phenomenon you're trying to show, which is why a longer time scale isn't appropriate, and (2) is long enough to be statistically significant and to average over normal interannual variability and decadal-scale ocean oscillations, which is why a shorter time scale isn't appropriate. If you'd like to understand more about how timescales impact the signal to noise ratio of temperature data, [this is a place to start](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JD016263/pdf). 

The fact remains, my original statement - ""winter temperatures in the Northeast have risen by ~4F since 1970"" is factual. You seem to have moved the goalposts from ""is it factual"" (which it clearly is) to ""is it relevant"" which is a reasonable question, but one which I have addressed.

"1522","co41faf","1","0","t1_co3jdbw","That's a vast oversimplification. A significant majority (66%) believe that a change is happening, but only a few believe that it's mostly anthropogenic. More believe that it's anthropogenic than believe that there is no change occurring (3.5%). 33% believe it's a mix of anthropocentric and natural, and 31% are ""uncertain"". Majorities express concerns about increases in droughts and heat stress. 

These numbers are largely in agreement with other studies of large scale cash crop producers, which have found between 35 and 45% believe that human activities are influencing the climate. 

So it's not really correct to say ""they don't believe it"". This matters a lot if your goal is adaptive (increasing producer resilience in the face of climatic uncertainty) as opposed to mitigative (reductions in emissions). 66% agree that ""farmers should take steps to protect land from increased weather variability"". 

The Arbuckle study is going to be the gold standard of social science on this topic for a while. It's a massive and very well thought out effort.

You only have to go to a western country and drive around to see farms covering most of the landscape where forests and grasslands once stood, rivers that have been dammed and diverted. That should put to rest arguments that 'Mother Nature/God is greater than humans'. Not that this is inherently bad - without such changes humans would not have developed as we have, but its clear that we have radically altered the pervasive natural environment that existed before humans. 

The question of whether we have altered the climate is of course somewhat more contentious. Some would argue that we are too small to do such a thing, and some would argue that we're not. From a paleoclimate view, we have ice core records going back around 800,000 years. These records show a remarkable correlation between CO2 and Temperature over this time interval. CO2 fluctuated between 180ppm during glacial periods, to 280ppm during interglacial periods. The global temperature fluctuated by about 3°C in phase with these changes in CO2. But bear in mind that these changes were slow - changes of 100ppm in CO2 took place over 10,000 years, so about 1ppm per century, and were driven primarily by changes in oceanic storage and ventilation of CO2. Now we are up to about 400ppm, a change about 100 times faster than in the past. It's clear therefore, that the composition of our atmosphere has been altered almost solely by human activity, with the next question being what the response of Temperature to that change will be. My view, as a paleoclimatologist, is that the role of CO2 in radiative forcing of the past climate is so ubiquitous, that to suggest it won't have an effect on future climate would be foolhardy. How large an effect, and how quickly, is difficult to say, and there are thousands of scientists working on that problem right now, with the emerging consensus being that this will lead to significant Temperature increases (with most realistic estimates in the region of 2°C +/- 1 °C) by the end of this century.

"1530","co4qn18","3","0","t3_2u1j3m","I think the evidence is pretty clear that atmospheric CO2 and CH4 have gone up as the result of human activity.  We know this because we can take samples of ice cores and see what those gasses were in the past.  We can measure infrared radiation (IR) absorption in the presence of CO2 or CH4 in the lab and understand that they are opaque to IR in certain bands.  Thus, it stands to reason that a portion of the observed warming during the last century is due to those increases.  How much of the warming is due to those gases is still debated.

Where the big debate exists, though, is in all the knock-on effects caused by a little warming.  These are referred to feedbacks.  If net feedbacks lead to even more warming, they are net positive.  If net feedbacks lead to cooling, they are net negative.  Most climate scientists believe that the feedbacks are net positive, but the range of speculated net feedbacks is huge, making any projection of the future highly uncertain.

Now, it could be asked, has humanity caused temperature changes (and hence climatic shifts) as large as those observed on geological timescales?  It's clear we haven't.  Not even close.  One would have to assume the very high end of possible positive feedbacks and fossil fuels reserves to get us into the same ballpark.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2u1j3m",1422549625,2015-01-29 16:40:25,"Will_Power"

"1532","co4taj7","3","0","t3_2u1j3m","I'm confused by your question. You seem to be saying we don't have enough data to understand the historical significance of the current warming trends, but you back that up by citing paleoclimatic data going back some 700 million years. 

One of the ways we validate climate models is by seeing if they react to changes in CO2 the same way the earth's climate has in the past. So we use paleoclimatic records along with estimates of atmospheric CO2 from ice cores to model that history. Obviously the farther back we go the more uncertain the data become, but we can say with very high certainty that (1) increases in CO2 will increase radiative forcing to the atmosphere, and (2) negative feedbacks seem not to be sufficient to damp this warming.

Would 135 years (roughly, humans have been keeping temperature records far longer than that, actually, but they tend to be sparse and of questionable precision) *in and of itself* be enough? Clearly, the answer is no. But no one is claiming that.

The idea that human emissions of CO2 could potentially alter the energy balance of the planet date back to (somewhat ironically) around the time detailed temperature records began - 1896, when Svente Arrhenius estimated that a doubling of CO2 would result in a warming of 5-6 degrees C (on the high end of modern estimates, but a surprisingly robust finding given the crude tools he had to work with). So clearly the theory that humans can impact the climate in not based on observing the temperature trends and then looking for an explanation. Rather the theory is based on our understanding of the basic physics of gasses, and the predictions that come from that are validated by the recent rise in temperatures. 

Would it be nice to have a longer dataset? Sure it would. That would be great. But we don't, and we have to work with what we have. Scientists have done a lot of work to separate the antropogenic signal from natural variability; this work involves some uncertainty, of course, but overall the findings appear to be quite robust. What's more, there is no competing model of the climate system that doesn't show and increase in temperature with rising CO2. 

There's a legitimate place for discussion of climate sensitivity and the relative importance of feedbacks like cloud formation and the collapse of methane hydrates, say. But it is our understanding of the very paleoclimatic events you cited that help us bound the sensitivity question. If increasing temperatures created so much more cloud cover that it effectively countered much of the warming (couldn't counter all of if, or the feedback would never occur) then we wouldn't have seen the warming events in the past. So while it's possible that clouds could bail us out of some of the issue (while creating problems of their own, of course) it's clear that dramatic changes in the net energy balance are indeed consistent with the behavior of the climate system.

So do these predictions pan out? Yes, absolutely - this is one of the key pieces of data that point to a human fingerprint on the recent changes in global temperature.

People have been criticising a UN report? Surely not! 

Nevertheless, I think you'll find if you look into it that the reason why the forecasts were revised upwards is that real world data was showing that birthrates in developing countries were not declining as fast as had been anticipated in previous forecasts.

*“In some cases, the actual level of fertility appears to have risen in recent years; in other cases, the previous estimate was too low,” said the Director of the Population Division in the UN’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs, John Wilmoth, during a press conference in New York.*

*“While there has been a rapid fall in the average number of children per woman in large developing countries such as China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Brazil and South Africa […] rapid growth is expected to continue over the next few decades in countries with high levels of fertility such as Nigeria, Niger, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Uganda but also Afghanistan and Timor-Leste, where there are more than five children per woman.”*

"1575","co6xnvi","1","0","t1_co6qwrp","These sorts of adjustments are necessary for making datasets that are not completely homogeneous comparable. There are systematic predictable biases that are introduced through methodological changes that make comparing raw data from one time period to another inaccurate. I'm not an expert on the adjustments that the GISS does, but here are some examples of the sorts of things they do: 

1) Correct for urban heat island effects. A station may have been located in a rural area but since had development around it. Because urbanization raises the local temperatures, that station's data will be adjusted downward to compensate. Generally this is done by comparing that stations data to another nearby station that hasn't seen the same level of urbanization.

2) The number of stations and the relative urban/rural mix has changed over time, especially as systems that allow remote stations to operate cheaply and autonomously have come online. If, for instance, the historical mix was 30 rural stations and 70 urban stations, and the current mix is 100 rural stations and 100 urban stations, the relative bias caused by the urban heat island effect will change, so these stations will need to be weighted accordingly during homogenization. 

3) Collection methods have changed - historically some data may have come from manual thermometer reading or daily min/max recording thermometers. Modern systems collect data at 15 minute or finer time steps. These changes need to be accounted for. A change in the type of thermistor used to measure temperature might cause a discontinuity. The time of day that manual readings were taken could have an impact.

4) some stations have been moved, so data are adjusted to account for known changes of this sort, correcting any discontinuity that occurs in that data that isn't corroborated by nearby stations that haven't moved. 

5) Other unknown effects - perhaps a tree grew and started shading a particular station, or birds built a nest on the enclosure, or who knows what. If one station shows a change that's not corroborated by those around it, it can be adjusted to match the larger scale observed trend. 

Here's some information from GISS: 

[Q. Why can't we use just raw data?
A. Just averaging the raw data would give results that are highly dependent on the particular locations \(latitude and elevation\) and reporting periods of the actual weather stations; such results would mostly reflect those accidental circumstances rather than yield meaningful information about our climate.

Q. Can you illustrate the above with a simple example?
A. Assume, e.g., that a station at the bottom of a mountain sent in reports continuously starting in 1880 and assume that a station was built near the top of that mountain and started reporting in 1900. Since those new temperatures are much lower than the temperatures from the station in the valley, averaging the two temperature series would create a substantial temperature drop starting in 1900.

Q. How can we combine the data of the two stations above in a meaningful way?
A. What may be done before combining those data is to increase the new data or lower the old ones until the two series seem consistent. How much we have to adjust these data may be estimated by comparing the time period with reports from both stations: After the offset, the averages over the common period should be equal. (This is the basis for the GISS method). As new data become available, the offset determined using that method may change. This explains why additional recent data can impact also much earlier data in any regional or global time series.](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/FAQ.html)

The big thing to understand is that the surface temperature station network has changed and improved significantly over the period of record. For the most part while some data exist prior to 1880 the density of the recording network was not sufficient to homogenize over large areas, so that's when we start having these large scale instrumental records. 

The implication of the article is that the adjustments are done in secret and the methodologies are not available - this is absolutely untrue. All of the methods are published. Note that the articles criticizing this never criticize the actual methodologies, just the fact that adjustments are made at all - this is deeply intellectually dishonest. 

As a side note - earlier data do have somewhat higher uncertainties; the error for global mean temps around 1900 is estimated at 0.1C, while uncertainty for modern estimates of GMT are roughly half that (95% certaintly, I believe, though I'm not sure of that).

That all depends on what your 'current electricity production methods' are. The carbon intensity of a typical 37mpg(UK) small car is 240gCO2e/km. The carbon intensity associated with electric cars in regions with coal-dominated electricity generation are well above that, as shown by the evidence you offered.

The rise in CO2 emissions from increasing electric cars is clearly not a bug in the tool, since the carbon intensity of the additional global electricity generation added is higher than the expected carbon intensity of ICE cars that would be replaced.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2u3vkl",1422823503,2015-02-01 20:45:03,"JRugman"

Last time I checked, coal was a fossil fuel. I assumed that if you wanted to check the data for yourself, you'd look at the tool.

You were the one to move the goalposts once I showed that the sources you provided support the straightforward claims I had been making.

The questions you need to be asking yourself are: ""*what is the carbon intensity of the generation mix of additional electricity that would be needed to power the widespread adoption of EVs and hydrogen powered cars, and how does that compare to the carbon intensity of petrol cars that would be replaced?*"", and ""*what additional carbon emissions would result from building the infrastructure needed to support the widespread adoption of EVs and hydrogen powered cars?*"", and possibly also ""*what emissions would be associated with prematurely taking petrol cars off the road before the end of their useful life in order to replace them with EVs?*"".

They don't address that other researchers have independently calibrated the Paraguay data and found very similar results to NOAA's.

The article doesn't address the fact (shown in the video) that the adjusted data makes very little difference in the calculated global mean warming; this of course is because the idea that stations are being deliberately and systematically adjusted to show warming where there is none is false; in fact stations are adjusted just as much to show less warming as more (remember Dublin Airport?). 

The data are adjusted because NOAA is committed to showing the temperature record at each station as accurately as possible, given the information that we have. Period, end of story.

I agree that her decision to post on Watts' site is a poor one, but she's not dumb. 

In the case of this article I'd say she's right on - there are significant issues about applying GCMs at the regional/local scale, and concerns about overfitting and the lack of independent validation are also legitimate. The fact that model ensembles are presented as if they represent a probability distribution of possible outcomes is a problem. None of this means that CC isn't happening, or that modelers are acting in bad faith, but rather that as the science has progressed we're reaching the limit of the model's ability to give us the information that we need. Getting past that limit requires a hard, honest look at where and how they're failing. 

This isn't really new, but it's something that needs to get talked about in the context of adaptive planning. Curry's conclusion (""The thesis provides a very strong argument that GCM climate models are not fit for the purpose of regional impact assessments"") is, if not an unassailable position, one that deserves a serious and reasoned response.

&gt; Judith Curry is a bit more skeptical than I think the science justifies at this point, but unlike some she is a good faith actor.

But *is* she? 

As is implied by your comment, there already exists a conversation in the literature and research communities about the utility of GCMs for downscaling and for regional impact assessments. That's neither new nor novel. In fact, I read through the relevant part of the dissertation yesterday evening and I didn't really find too much new thought in there that I hadn't already seen discussed - formally - at both departmental seminars and at niche conferences. 

Herein lies the problem with how Dr. Curry conducts her online persona. I've seen *her* raise these same concerns - **years** ago in a room full of very big name people. The difference is that she raised them with the appropriate contextualization, which you repeat here: whether or not multi-model ensembles are enough to produce reliable PDFs of modeled responses important *for multi-scale impact assessments*. Already, the dialogue which Dr. Curry started has spun out of control. Many comments I've seen on Climate Etc and beyond extrapolate far beyond this context, in ways which the arguments being offered cannot possibly support. That's beyond Dr. Curry's control in some ways, but I don't think she did nearly enough to contextualize for her audience - particularly lay members who do not have a good grasp on what the ""climate modeling paradigm"" is in the first place - what the arguments do and do not support.

Aaaaannnddd then there's this nugget:

&gt; I seriously doubt that such a thesis would be possible in an atmospheric/oceanic/climate science department in the U.S. – whether the student would dare to tackle this, whether a faculty member would agree to supervise this, and whether a committee would ‘pass’ the thesis.

That's a **dog whistle**. And not even a clever or subtle one at that. It's a hand-wavy statement meant to rile up an emotional response along the lines of, ""*zOMG the alarmist scientists have been wrong all along and they're crushing dissent from anyone who cries foul!*""

Of course, you know, Dr. Curry is one of the few people who is *actually* in a position to qualify such a statement, since she chaired a freakin' Atmospheric Sciences department for part of a decade. But... she doesn't. Because it's a load of BS. In fact, I've seen quite a few projects tackle the inadequacies of GCMs for various regional climate applications, from many different realms including dynamics (of atmosphere, ocean, and/or climate ), chemistry, and beyond. Actually - I can't think of any dissertation I've skimmed in the past few years which used GCMs and **didn't** explicitly call into question a major deficiency for what they were being used to study. Why bother writing a PhD-level dissertation if you're not going to rigorously dissect such a problem, and then attempt to fix it or contextualize it?

It's disingenuous, and Dr. Curry is far too smart to not understand exactly what she is doing when she makes statements like that. And *that* is why people get pissed at her. They *love* when she or anyone else raises these issues in the literature or at a conference - it provokes discussion and debate which leads to good science and better understanding. But it accomplishes the exact opposite when these sorts of issues are thrown out with dog whistles and poor/non-existent contextualization on blogs.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2ujx1j",1422986107,2015-02-03 17:55:07,"counters"

They are being good scientists by acknowledging that.

To illustrate, if a scientist personally believes that roughly half of the warming during the 20th century was due to mankind, but that there are error bars around that number, he or she would be within the 14%.

You're now bringing up yet another Goddard/Heller claim (do you have any other sources?) about infilling in the USHCN network; I assume you've called your congressman to ask them to support continued funding for the legacy monitoring network, but since that hasn't come through... While it's true that estimated temperatures are published for stations which have been discontinued, these data are estimated after homogenization and TOBs corrections, and they don't impact estimates of mean temperature. It's simply a way to have some data to compare to historical data at a particular site. What's more, they only cover the US which makes them rather irrelevant to this discussion. 

No one with any sense is arguing about which is the hottest year ever, nor would a (imagninary) bias of ~0.00048 degrees per year make any difference in whether it was 2014 (48% chance), or 2010 (18% chance), or 2005 (13%), or 2013 (6%) or maybe, just maybe, 1998 (5% chance).

I'm not a consumer of the sort of GCM output that the dissertation and blog post are about. Instead, we build, modify, and use GCMs to study physics and chemistry within the climate system with the express intent of trying to understand observations from field campaigns and long-term experiments. For that, we really just need two things: (1) good large-scale dynamics and drivers of meteorology, and (2) accurate representations of atmospheric chemistry, particularly with respect to aerosols. 

(1) is rather easy to do. We're getting better at (2) but it's a tough problem. My group is currently finalizing a paper to be submitted to Nature which is a first-of-its-kind global climatology of a particular air pollution phenomenon built using in-situ observations, remote sensing from modern space-borne platforms, and a heavily modified coupled-aerosol-climate model. If we succeed in peer review, it'll be a big deal - especially if one of the events we care about is occurring in Beijing at the time its published. Which means press interest. Which means a skeptic blog-o-sphere lambasting us for using a model without understanding how or why we had to use a model in the first place.

But this is besides the point. GCMs are useful for certain tasks. Regional/decadal modeling for adaptation purposes?

One of the first things a student learn about GCMs is how badly they get so many things wrong. But when you start digging really deep, you discover the many things that they get right, and when you combine that with some creativity, you can use them to glean some deep insights into interconnections between components of the climate system.

For instance, I study aerosols and their impact on clouds. Until CMIP5, this set of physics wasn't included in GCMs; in fact, even CMIP4 and CMIP5 have too-simple aerosol models to resolve many anthropogenic impacts on the ambient aerosol population. But like you, my research requires me to be very careful in figuring out how to ask the questions I care about in such a way that I can take advantage of the tools we *do* have available. And by doing that, we can begin to understand things like aerosol indirect effects on climate. It's just not as complete of a picture as we might care about, and we have to be pedantic about uncertainties and limitations.

Naysayers will spend all their time bemoaning the limitations, and ignore the valuable answers to smaller parts of the puzzle that researchers were able to solve.

But if you actually read it, you learn that he is specifically referring here to the climate of the United States, and goes on to talk about how there has been ""ubiquitous warming"" in the rest of the world, and there's even a graph there to prove it.

Also, this Hansen article was written ***more than fifteen years ago***. I'm sure a lot of things were said in 1999 that are no longer accurate today. Since then we have built more accurate climate models and collected more accurate data. And more extreme climate events have occurred - and the consensus is that many of those events were either caused or made worse by anthropogenic climate change.

In fact, Hansen even says that, multiple times: that as our climate models and data become more accurate over the next few years, we'll develop a better understanding of what's happening and where things are going. And that is exactly what happened.

As for this article's assertion that NOAA/NASA began ""doctoring"" temperature records, that seems to all be based on one animated gif of two graphs, with no source for those graphs provided. Until I see where those graphs came from, I have no reason to trust their authenticity. Everybody has Photoshop these days, including me. If an article intends to claim that the world's most pre-eminent climatological scientists are deliberately ""doctoring"" their data, it damn well better cite its sources for that claim.

Furthermore, **even if** those two graphs are authentic, the difference could simply be due to the gathering of more accurate data on climate history form things such as tree rings and ice cores, which can tell us about the climate many decades or centuries in the past.

Really? Because as far as I can tell, not many devices actually measure ""temperature"".

More sophisticated sensors use changes in electric currents or other techniques. But the temperature is always analyzed, not a basic measurement like length or time.

&gt; They dont need adjustment.

Sure they need some *quality control*. What if you *know* that a particular run of thermometers loses calibration after 500 days in a predictable way, and it turns out that there are a dozen or so stations that used those thermometers longer than that period of time? Do you just ignore the fact that they're definitely wrong and use their measurement anyways?

&gt; People have staked their reputation and a glut of government grants on agw. 

The easiest way to solidify one's reputation as a key scientific figure in the 21st century would be to come up with an argument dismantling the predominant ""climate change due to human GHG emissions"" paradigm. Furthermore, no ""government grant"" hinges on there being global warming; there's contemporary and pertinent interest in all aspects of the climate system for many reasons, and understanding how the climate will respond to GHG forcing is a tiny part of that.

I gave a very simple analysis using deduction. Here it is one more time, with the evidence supporting each statement in parentheses:

1. Curry is smart (evidence - many awards, accolades, accomplishments)

2. Curry knows these issues and their context (evidence - she herself as presented on them at conferences and seminars)

3. She presents the issues differently for her Climate Etc audience (evidence - read her comments and compare to the talks she's given on the topic at AGU, or to the dissertation she linked [it contextualizes the problem very differently than she does])

You haven't yet expressed concern towards any link in this rhetorical chain. Instead, you choose to *misrepresent* what I have said. That *misrepresentation* is in the quote that begins this comment. At best, you've attempted to muddy things about audience. Unfortunately, that works against you too because [Curry herself defines her audience](http://judithcurry.com/about/). In fact, she goes into more detail on her intended audience [in her very first post on her blog](http://judithcurry.com/2010/09/02/test/). So you've  now upped your score to 0.5 / 6.0.

I suppose I could get a protractor and then do a little trig and I could get my own answer. And assuming it was close to the 238,900 then I would KNOW.

However, an experiment proving beyond a doubt that global warming is the direct result of human behavior, to my knowledge, has not happened yet. I believe it, and it has plenty of evidence, so it is not solely taken on faith, but it is still at least in my mind possible, however unlikely, that the science could end up wrong.

If I lived on a farm in rural Nebraska, I'd probably deem farmers more trustworthy than business executives, simply because most of my family and the people I know are farmers and come from a long line of farmers.  If I grew up in an urban ghetto, surrounded by poor minorities, I'd trust a minority preacher before I'd trust a white politician.

How is it that people deem others trustworthy?  It's simple, really.  People like them, or people they know, or people with whom they have a shared experience and/or history.  If your bubble of influence is small, your tribe will be small.  If it is large, your tribe large.  And your trust will reflect the nature of your tribe.

As for distinguishing between the minds of scientists and politicians so cleanly, I think it really breaks down to how much you care to look.  If you trust scientists, and you know 100, and only 2 dissent, then you'll form a conclusion.  If you know 2 scientists, both of whom dissent, you'll form a conclusion.  Every person's belief system is founded upon the experiences they've had and the people they've met along the way.  Children overwhelmingly adopt the religion and political party of their parents.  This is because we form these bonds (and our definitions of who to trust) unconsciously and instinctively.  It takes an inordinate amount of rationalization and education to convince someone **out** of a belief structure they've been adopted into.  

So if we go back to the analysis, and I survey the literature, and I find 99 scientists telling me a basic set of facts, and I find 2 scientists telling me those facts are incorrect, and I find 99 politicians telling me a basic set of facts, and 2 of the politicians are telling me those facts are incorrect, the ""team"" I form will be independent of the information presented.  It will very rarely have anything to do with an objective analysis of the information.  It has to do with which team I find more trustworthy.

"1707","cobodii","0","0","t1_coawv39","&gt; Really? Because as far as I can tell, not many devices actually measure ""temperature"". A liquid-mercury thermometer measures the thermal expansion of a liquid in a chamber, which we use to infer temperature. More sophisticated sensors use changes in electric currents or other techniques. But the temperature is always analyzed, not a basic measurement like length or time.

Yet so damned many of them seem to be fairly accurate and yet such a substantial change in temporarture data can only scientifically be done in a lab.... not in nature where it is all taking place.

They dont need adjustment.
&gt;Sure they need some quality control. What if you know that a particular run of thermometers loses calibration after 500 days in a predictable way, and it turns out that there are a dozen or so stations that used those thermometers longer than that period of time? Do you just ignore the fact that they're definitely wrong and use their measurement anyways?

Really all thermometers and other scientific measuring tools are all wrong?  Numerous stations across the world all wrong at the same time? Yes you use the data because it a great deal of sampling across the globe. It's not the measurements that are wrong, it's the scientists committing the fraud that are wrong.  

Turning a cooling trend into a warming trend is fraud.
&gt;The various adjustments used to quality control the data do not change the long-term trend

If the cooling trend isn't going to change, then why change it to a warming trend? That would be the huge government grant riding on the uh... quality control changes. 

&gt;There are plenty of explanations that would allay your concerns if you choose to approach this rationally. I've only briefly touched upon them.

You haven't touched on any of them.

The data from the 90's is relevant because it is the start of the AGW craze by EAU fraudsters. They were caught, their faked models just vanished and they tried hard to shut down scientific dissent. All leaked from their emails.  Why?  Lucrative government grants I would bet. 


Just a few, of what I am sure are thousands of articles picking apart the consensus scientists and their shitty models.  Sadly meteorologist who are trained to predict weather can barely do it with even a shaky percentage of certainty from week to week and here you are, praying at the alter believing that somehow the climate gods are going to be right on. When your faith is shaken by facts, you'll say anything to comfort yourself in the fact that what you were told has to be the truth. Put your faith in the false globam warming god aside and do some research for yourself on bothsides.

"1708","cobpqfj","0","0","t1_cobfy3g","Within the climate science community there isn't much disagreement with the fact that the climate is changing, and that CO2 rate of release is unprecedented over human history, and that we are probably the primary driver, and that risk assessment is prudent.  Given that exactly zero of the professors I've ever actually had a conversation with or attended a lecture from disagreed with any of those points, I feel fairly confident that I can start from there and build a case.  To me they are trustworthy.  Their trustworthiness does not stem from the presentation of the particular material, like I said, except in very rare cases.  Instead it stems from my personal experience with them, their work ethic, their sense of integrity, and their passion for knowledge.  So no, trustworthiness does not have much of anything to do with who's espousing one set of opinions versus another.  

I think it's also worth noting, however, that anyone who sat through the tobacco debates while we were ravenously discussing how closely one could link tobacco smoke and lung cancer has already had direct experience with the slight of hand tricks that people play with datasets to construe a sense of uncertainty.  On top of the normal tribalistic tendencies, there's also a particular set of tricks that can be played, and angles that can be pushed, and indeed that have been verifiably pushed, by moneyed interests who stood to benefit from the status quo.  Trustworthiness also has a bit to do with which side of the debate held true to empirical observations during that nasty fight, and which one caved to the power of profit at the expense of honesty, integrity, and full disclosure.  So through the lens of the climate debate, when these same tactics tend to rear their ugly heads, it triggers feelings of distrust in people with direct experience of the analogue.  That distrust is usually aimed at big businesses and politicians, who don't really have the best track record with the whole ""objective honesty"" thing, even with something as clearly harmful to human health as burning the end of a tobacco stick and sucking on it.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2usoa0",1423110515,2015-02-05 04:28:35,"plathtic_thong"

I completely agree with you, though what those technologies are is matter for debate. Yes, nuclear would be an excellent, but it's such a hard sell anywhere that it seems unlikely we'll see a boom in nuclear plants any time soon (pun not intended). Renewables may or may not be as good a choice, but they do have the momentum, and when dealing with such large-scale projects momentum is the key. I personally do not favor one over the other, there are good arguments for both. My opinion (and it really is just an opinion) is the best solution *right now* seems to be a renewables + natural gas combo, with the latter a stopgap measure until intermittency becomes less of a problem.

Only time will tell; however, the rate of heat accumulation in the entire climate system, including oceans, indicates that the more recent papers will eventually prove better.

&gt;even the Curry/Lewis paper has an upper bound of 4C

True.  That is a lower upper bound, if you'll pardon the verbiage, than those seen in the paleo papers, though.

&gt;Yes, nuclear would be an excellent, but it's such a hard sell anywhere that it seems unlikely we'll see a boom in nuclear plants any time soon (pun not intended).

Excellent pun, whether intended or not.  I think nuclear is expanding quite well outside of the U.S. and Europe.  I expect new plants to roughly offset retiring plants in the U.S. in the near term.  I expect nuclear will decline in Europe, except in France and Northern Europe.  Maybe Eastern Europe will see some sort of partnership with Russia, but I kind of doubt it.  Russia itself will keep plowing forward with new nuclear.  They are actually ahead in some respects, given that they are building their second active breeder reactor as we type (third overall, the first was retired).

China and India will be building nuclear at an increasing rate in coming years, and China has already been building like mad.  Several other countries in Asia and the Middle East will be bringing reactors on line in coming years as well.

I'll be watching next gen reactors very closely.  There are a number of companies in the U.S. and Canada that are doing some good developmental work on small modular reactors.  The great part about modular reactors is that they can be factory built, not built on site.  It's China that really takes the prize with nuclear R&amp;D, though.  Last I heard, the Chinese Academy of Sciences had 400 PhDs working on their molten salt stuff.  They expected to have a test reactor online in five years, then start factory producing the things within ten.

&gt;Renewables may or may not be as good a choice, but they do have the momentum, and when dealing with such large-scale projects momentum is the key. 

I am a fan of renewables in the right locations for the right purposes.  A year ago, I think I would have agreed with you that renewables have the momentum.  Lately, though, I'm beginning to wonder.  It seems that as subsidies have been withdrawn, the number of planned projects has dropped off rather precipitously.  The idea with subsidies was that they would be temporary while production facilities scaled up.  Now it seems as though the economies of scale weren't enough on their own.  It's still too early to say for sure, so I'll simply state that I have some reservations about drawing exponential curves on ""installed renewables"" charts.

Personally, I think that there should be some consideration of very large scale storage systems, particularly pumped hydro.  This would help every sort of production, renewable and nuclear alike.  Baseload capacity (nuclear) could be oversized, with spare production filling high-elevation reservoirs at night, then excess renewable energy could fill the same reservoirs during the day.  I think this becomes even more compelling if we factor electric vehicles into the equation.  Oversized baseload would allow cheaper charging at night.  A rough, sketch, I know, and really most applicable to areas with mountains, but that's what I envision.

&gt;Anyway, I don't expect we'll agree on everything, but thanks again for the polite, reasoned argument.

"1723","cocd7y7","1","0","t3_2usoa0","It is extremely likely that there is manmade warming occuring. 

We know that CO2 plays a critical role in maintaining the energy balance of the planet and is a significant factor in maintaining our surface temperatures. This has been known for around 150 years. 

We know that humans are emitting enough CO2 to significantly alter the atmospheric concentration. 

We know that atmospheric CO2 has [risen sharply](http://www.skepticalscience.com/images/co2_10000_years.gif) since the industrial revolution, and (from isotope ratios) we know that this rise is attributable to the burning of fossil fuels. 

We have physical models of the climate system that do a remarkably good job of replicating historical global temperatures, [but only when the influence of human CO2 emissions is included.](http://www.skepticalscience.com/images/IPCC_model_vs_obs.gif) 

No physical model of the earth's climate has been made that can recreate observed historical temperatures without including the influence of human emissions. Given the fact that such a model would be a powerful argument against the consensus view, and given the amount of money and effort going into discrediting the consensus view, it seems unlikely that no one has tried to create such a model. 

So there are two possibilities: 

1) The consensus view is correct, climate change is happening and is largely driven by human activities. 

2) The consensus view is incorrect, the strong match between the models and the historical temperature record is coincidental, and the drivers of the earth's climate are processes we don't understand at all.

Is #2 possible? Yes, like any scientific theory it represents only our best understanding of a system, and we could be wrong. But for it to be true a huge body of science dating back well over 100 years would have to be wrong. In this light #1 is far, far more likely to be correct.

I think there is a problem in framing it that way.  All the evidence you cited to supports the consensus view the a portion of the warming during the 20th century was due to mankind.  It is a consensus so broadly defined that most skeptics would agree with it.  

It does not follow from that consensus that future warming will be either drastic or dangerous.  I think that's the flaw in trying to use consensus as the argument for action: one cannot build consensus on future projections of any complex system.

Instead, I think a better approach is a clear delineation of possible outcomes from climate change and a roadmap toward a full energy overhaul.  Policies that try to pick a winner, such as short-term renewables subsidies based on expenditure, are not the answer.  Those advocating action on climate change must first and foremost recognize that an energy overhaul of the magnitude needed must include a significant nuclear component.  They must then clean their own house by cutting ENGOs out of the discussion who oppose nuclear power.  That means no more Greenpeace, Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists, etc, etc.  Until those advocating for change show they are committed to all solutions, nothing meaningful is going to happen.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2usoa0",1423242696,2015-02-06 17:11:36,"Will_Power"

I don't recall if you and I have discussed this topic before, so forgive me if we have.  I find a compelling case that mitigation will be chosen for us because economically viable fossil fuel resources are more limited than most people understand.  We've already seen a peak in conventional oil.  We may be looking at a peak in unconventionals if oil prices remain low much longer.  Natural gas will peak in a few decades' time.

It is telling that in all this ""debate"" no one has made either of two important claims:

1) significantly more stations have been adjusted upwards than downwards

2) these adjustments have a significant impact on estimates of global temperatures.

Why don't they make these claims? Because they're not defensible. So instead they imply that all the adjustments are upwards and that the measured changes are all fake. In reality the estimates of global temperature from the adjusted and unadjusted data are virtually indistinguishable, which is what you'd expect from a process like homogenization, which should have little impact on the mean of the dataset.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2v74z7",1423431706,2015-02-08 21:41:46,"fishsticks40"

I'm not quite sure what you're saying here. Not all adjustments result in warming; many of the adjustments result in a reduction in observed warming. If you can quote the exact part of the article you're referring to I might be able to respond better. 

As to the 0.5 C from TOBs adjustments - If I'm right about which criticism you're referring to ([is it this one?](https://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/2010/09/25/thermometer-magic/)) note that this dataset (the USHCN) covers only the United States, or a little less than 2% of the earth's surface. The TOBs adjustments here are likely all in the same direction, because all the measurements were done according to one centralized protocol; that's not true globally. 

The key figure in the article I linked is figure 5; there you can see global reconstructions based on both the adjusted and unadjusted data; there's a very slight increase in warming observed in the adjusted data, but it's very, very slight. What's more, the data from the GHCN agrees very closely with data from other independent datasets. 

The implication of these claims is that the observed warming is an artifact of data adjustments. This is simply untrue. The raw data shows about 97% as much warming over the past 50 years; it's not like there was a magical goal we had to hit to claim ""it's warming!"" so there'd really be no reason to show false data when the real data tell the same story.

How much additional heat (from somewhere/anywhere) would it take to melt the North Pole. If you could add a specific amount of heat, how much heat would it take to melt ice over thousands of miles?

 Firstly you once again have avoided mentioning the melting Ice Cap and that is both telling and rather sad.

Is this supposed to prove something? A more useful statistic is how many billions of tons of carbon is released into the atmosphere by 7 billion people? We in the USA release something on the order of 30 billion tons each year. 30 billion tons of a gas - think of the volume! China is probably the same or maybe even worse by now. Europe and Russia? 

And that is not counting the methane from 1.4 billion cows and nearly a billion pigs. 

We burn so much coal and oil that the Grand Canyon is regularly filled with the pale blue haze of smog and air pollution. 

You play that statistic game of put us all together in a small spot (Originally it was if every person would stand on the island of Zanzibar). Yeah and? What? it is not us as living bodies it is us as represented in burned fuel, water supplies and agricultural run off etc. We or rather the young people are in for a rough ride starting in a decade or two. What is scary is that even then... it will keep on getting warmer slowly but surely each year (on average).

It will never get cooler for a long long time to come. It will always keep getting hotter and hotter. Each decade will be hotter than the previous etc.

"1794","cofy3hb","1","0","t1_coft51a","No, one could claim the same about temperature *trends* and indeed that's precisely what I'm claiming. If the adjustments for change the temperatures for each year, they don't change the trends. The adjustments lead to about about 3% of the observed trend over the past 50 years. This is why these articles rarely actually make the claim explicitly that these adjustments are impacting estimates of global trends, but instead just make the *implication* that this is being done to manufacture warming globally. It's not, and if it were it wouldn't work. Why would you engage in a conspiracy that doesn't work and then publish your non tampered data along with explanations of how you made the adjustments, when you could just lie from the outset?

I did the math on one of these other posts, IIRC the difference attributable to adjustments was something like 1/30th of the difference in temperature between 2010 and 2014. I'm on my phone but I'll find it in a bit. The adjustments done on 2010 aren't remarkably different. Also scientists are not invested in pretending 2014 was the hottest yet when it wasn't; if they were why wasn't 2013 the hottest too? Or 2012? If Kim Jong Un can win every basketball game he plays surely we could do the same with temperature.

Remember what the process of homogenization is - spatially weighted averages, essentially. There's no reason to think it would impact the large scale mean, and it doesn't.

They do strongly impact the trends at individual sites, which is why they're done; so local and regional trends can be accurately tracked.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2v74z7",1423489832,2015-02-09 13:50:32,"fishsticks40"

It's the translation of a thesis (in Greek), thus peer reviewed.  And also happened to be used as a presentation.

No. It does not. 

~~Your first graph shows the *difference between 2 methods of adjustment*, not the net effect of overall adjustment.~~ (edit: mixed up captions and graphs. Discussion of numbers below more relevant).

Your second graph is a cloud of dots which sheds very little light on the issue at hand. It does not address the fact some stations are *much* more heavily weighted in determining the global average temperature. 


&gt;Over the period 1951-2010 the corrected data show a trend of 0.18 C/decade, while the uncorrected data show a trend of 0.16 C/decade. 

So 0.18 C/decade - 0.16 C/decade = 0.02 C/decade = 0.2/century


But the above article is not addressing merely the record since 1951. It's addressing the entire temperature record. 

Alas, your [Lawrimore 2011 paper](http://i.imgur.com/NJOb0rB.png) says this:

&gt; The
difference in the 1880–2010 global trends between the cor-
rected and uncorrected version 3 data approaches 0.2°C per
century

Adjustments of 0.2 C/Century in a temp rise of 0.7 or 0.8 deg/Century is at least 25% of the long term trend - an order of magnitude more than the 3% you claim - and far closer to the 0.3C I quoted earlier.

&gt;Your first graph shows the difference between 2 methods of adjustment, not the net effect of overall adjustment.

Wrong. Dead, flat wrong. It shows the bias corrected GHCNv3 vs the uncorrected GHCNv3, as is clearly shown in the figure caption I quoted (""v3 bias corrected minus v3 uncorrected""). I'm not sure what two ""different methods of adjustment"" you think it's comparing - figure *15* compares the corrected GHCNv2 to GHCNv3, but this is figure *16*.

If you'll look back to the claim I made, it was specifically about the past 50 years. Over that time the adjustments to land surface stations (which is what the whole flap about homogenization is about) amount to around 10% of the observed warming. But the land surface is only around 30% of the earth, and so the supposed deliberate manipulation of land surface stations could only impact roughly 30% of the overall warming. What's 30% of 10%? 3%. 

Alas, the paper also says this: 

&gt;there is very little difference between trends in the corrected and uncorrected data in the periods since 1950 as shown in Table 4.

If that's how you define ""peer review"" sure. But it still does not negate the fact that it was reviewed by experts in the field.  

And the findings were not greatly out of line with the paper you cited. 

&gt;I'm not sure what two ""different methods of adjustment"" you think it's comparing - figure 15 compares the corrected GHCNv2 to GHCNv3, but this is figure 16. 

My bad. As you guessed, I crossed up captions with graphs.  

&gt;If you'll look back to the claim I made, it was specifically about the past 50 years. Over that time the adjustments to land surface stations (which is what the whole flap about homogenization is about) amount to around 10% of the observed warming.

The flap is about the entire record. Not just since 1950.

&gt;But the land surface is only around 30% of the earth, and so the supposed deliberate manipulation of land surface stations could only impact roughly 30% of the overall warming.

Those land stations are being extrapolated over ocean areas, especially in the Arctic. 

And the ocean temps have had some major controversial adjustments too - especially for time periods around WWII.  



&gt;Which is what I claimed from the beginning. 

So your claim at the beginning wasn't *actually* responsive to what was being said. 

Your 3% (10% of 30%):

- ignores periods prior to 1950.

- assumes the sea surface temperature record is pristine - and is completely disconnected from the land record.

edit to add:

What really gets me: given UHI, and the infeasibility of eliminating airports from the GHCN as is done for the USHCN, one would think global land adjustments should be leaning the *other* direction.

"1835","cogmlu7","1","0","t1_cogd35j","&gt; It's hard to reconcile these graphs against anthropogenic CO2 as being the most significant driver for temperature change.

This would be true, if in fact we needed anthropogenic CO2 to explain that part of the record. But in fact that rise is largely explained by an [increase in solar radiation](http://imgur.com/QYaBAgL) (temperature from NASA GISS; solar from Solanski 1998 and PMOD) and a [lull in volcanic activity](http://imgur.com/JUXYzaE) (from IPCC AR4), along with a much smaller anthropogenic forcing. Since around 1950 solar radiation has been steady or slightly declining, while volcanic activity has been significant. 

In other words, there are good rational reasons for that rise (which are supported by the climate models) which don't explain the increase from 1970 to the present. 

You seem to be making the fairly common mistake of assuming that scientists saw an increase in temperature and went looking for ways to explain it. What actually happened is that scientists realized that CO2 in the atmosphere is a major controller of the earth's temperature (1824-1860), that we're capable of altering that enough to cause a change (1896), and the temperature observations are simply confirming that that understanding is correct. 

We don't claim that CO2 is the only possible driver of changes in climate, or that no other drivers have ever played a role in the earth's climate. We do claim that it is one of the major drivers, that there is no other known driver that explains the current warming, and that the CO2 record does a remarkably good job of explaining it. In science when you have one theory that seems to explain what you observe, and there's no competing theory that does the same, you assume that the prevailing theory is true until there's a reason not to. This is true of climate, and gravity, and evolution, and semiconductor physics. ","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2v8xp4",1423534446,2015-02-10 02:14:06,"fishsticks40"

Your conclusion rests on many fortuitous coincidences to be true and left out other counter-factors such as aerosol and particulate reduction compared to the levels present at the beginning of the 20th century.

Confounding your conclusion is the fact atmospheric CO2 is increasing at a non-linear rate while global temperatures have been effectively at a standstill for the last 18 years. This of course is explained away with further unusual coincidences, 58 have been proposed at last count.

The problem is that there is no alternative theory that comes close to the explanatory power of the consensus view on climate change, and the things it fails to explain are minor compared with what it does. It is far more likely that things like the ""pause"" will be explained by one or more of what Watts calls ""excuses"" than by a paradigm shift in our understanding of the climate system. 

Simply pointing out the known weaknesses in a theory is not helpful - the people working in the field understand them better than you do, they think about them all the time.

It reduced the numerator to help make your 3% number look conveniently small.

Edit to add:

http://judithcurry.com/2012/03/15/on-the-adjustments-to-the-hadsst3-data-set-2/

&gt;**Conclusion**

&gt;HadSST3 contains a series of adjustments. With the exception of the war-time glitch, they are not obvious from study of the record. Their existence is based on speculation and hypothesis. Calculation of the biases involves inverting a significant portion of written record’s meta-data for the period of the principal adjustment and ignoring detailed studies on the proportion and timing of changes in data sampling methods as well a speculation as to the magnitude of the various effects.

&gt;The principal effect of these adjustments is to selectively remove the majority of the long term variation from the earlier 2/3 of the data record and to disrupt circa 10-11y patterns clearly visible in the data. These changes are fundamentally altering the character of the original data.

&gt;The strong similarity in form between the variations in the original ICOADS data and the corrections deemed necessary to correct sampling biases is remarkable. All the more so in view of the lack of documentary information on which to base the estimated magnitude and timing of the adjustments.

&gt;The analysis presented here indicates that, outside the immediate war-time period, these adjustments are distorting and degrading the data rather than improving it.

From the [Remote Sensing System blog](http://www.remss.com/blog/recent-slowing-rise-global-temperatures):

&gt;*Does this slow-down in the warming mean that the idea of anthropogenic global warming is no longer valid?  The short answer is ‘no’.  The denialists like to assume that the cause for the model/observation discrepancy is some kind of problem with the fundamental model physics, and they pooh-pooh any other sort of explanation.  This leads them to conclude, very likely erroneously, that the long-term sensitivity of the climate is much less than is currently thought.*

&gt;*The truth is that there are lots of causes besides errors in the fundamental model physics that could lead to the model/observation discrepancy.  I summarize a number of these possible causes below.  Without convincing evidence of model physics flaws (and I haven’t seen any), I would say that the possible causes described below need to be investigated and ruled out before we can pin the blame on fundamental modelling errors.*

You realize that satellites don't actually measure temperatures (only *infer* them), and that without ground-based measurements for calibration they are basically useless, right?

NASA doesn't believe satellites have replaced ground measurements, but rather that the two are complementary. The ground measurements are *just as good* as the satellite measurements, despite claims to the contrary by climate contrarians.

&gt;Now they completely ignore their own satellite data, both of which showed 2014 was not the hottest year.

There is no reason to believe that is the case. There is a *challenge*, because early recordings were not made for long-term climate study, but claiming it is unreliable and/or that it is being tampered with in order to overstate the warming without any actual evidence is politics, not science.

&gt;They need to be adjusted, homogenized, spun and manipulated.

What do you meant by ""spun"" and ""manipulated""?

As for adjustments, that happens quite a bit with satellite measurements as well. Remember, those satellites are not measuring actual temperatures, but rather inferring them from microwave measurements of the atmosphere at various altitudes. There's room for error in this as well (such as that induced by orbital drift), and both satellite datasets have seen major adjustments at some point of their history.

The [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_temperature_measurements) gives a pretty good summary:

&gt;*The temperature of the atmosphere at various altitudes as well as sea and land surface temperatures can be inferred from satellite measurements. Weather satellites do not measure temperature directly but measure radiances in various wavelength bands. These measurements can be used to locate weather fronts, monitor the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, determine the strength of tropical cyclones, study urban heat islands and monitor the global climate. Wildfires, volcanos, and industrial hot spots can also be found via thermal imaging from weather satellites.*

&gt;*Since 1978 Microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration polar orbiting satellites have measured the intensity of upwelling microwave radiation from atmospheric oxygen, which is proportional to the temperature of broad vertical layers of the atmosphere. Measurements of infrared radiation pertaining to sea surface temperature have been collected since 1967.*

&gt;*Satellite datasets show that over the past four decades the troposphere has warmed and the stratosphere has cooled. Both of these trends are consistent with the influence of increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.*

The important point here is that satellites do not measure ground temperatures, they measure temperatures in the lower troposphere, so of course some discrepancies are expect: they just don't measure the same thing.

They *do* follow each other very closely, though. This has supported the reliability of both the satellite and ground datasets. One isn't better than the other, because they *complement* each other.

&gt;They are not the actual temperatures because NOAA/GISS are not using them. 

Do you understand why using raw data would make the record *less* reliable, right?

&gt;The whole point of the satellite systems was to get global and accurate temperature data.

Well, it was not only that, and it was never meant to be the *only* source of temperature data.

&gt;Now, that data should be completely ignored because it doesn't fit the dogma.

I hope it's clear by now that I don't think any data should be ignored. I'm not going to repost the woodfortrees link again, but you'll not I use all four major datasets.

&gt;Wow, doesn't that sound just like Michael Mann?

Not really, no. Mann is mostly defending himself and his work from constant attacks, whereas Monckton is just in it for the drama.

The letter is s, the one that changes model into models. If the science were settled, there would be precisely one model, and it would be in agreement with measurements.

His ""one letter disproof"" is the fact that scientists around the world have been constructing models independently, rather than collaborating on one single model?

A few other things that jump out:

&gt; Not a single climate model predicted the current cooling phase.

What cooling phase?

&gt; CO2 concentration has risen and fallen in the past with no help from mankind.

The ratio of carbon isotopes in modern atmospheric CO2 is evidence that it is anthropogenic.

&gt; The melting point of ice is 0 ºC in Antarctica, just as it is everywhere else. The highest recorded temperature at the South Pole is –14 ºC, and the lowest is –117 ºC. How, pray, will a putative few degrees of warming melt all the ice and inundate Florida, as is claimed by the warming alarmists?

This is a straw man. I've never heard any climate scientist claim that the Antarctic will become completely ice free due to AGW in the near future.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2vrea7",1423835211,2015-02-13 13:46:51,"donaldosaurus"

&gt; A warmer world is a better world. Look at weather-related death rates in winter and in summer, and the case is overwhelming that warmer is better.

And what if warmer leads to drought? This is a huge sweeping statement with no factual basis.

&gt; A warmer world begets more precipitation.

Again, simply not true. This is a conceptual fallacy that warmer = more moisture in atmosphere = wetter. For example, its currently a controversial topic as to whether warming will result in an increase or decrease in the strength of the Pacific Walker circulation which will result in either more or less precipitation, respectively, in SE Asia. Thats just one area of the world.

&gt; The higher the CO2 levels, the more vibrant is the biosphere, as numerous experiments in greenhouses have shown. 

Perhaps, in idealised greenhouse experiments. But real-world experiments have found that plant growth responds much more prominently to water availability than CO2 variability - see my previous answers.

See this article: http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2014/12/recent-global-warming-trends-significant-or-paused-or-what/ or the quote I took from it below.

** Quote **
&gt;But the question the media love to debate is not: can we find a warming trend since 1998 which is outside what might be explained by natural variability? The question being debated is: is the warming since 1998 significantly less than the long-term warming trend? Significant again in the sense that the difference might not just be due to chance, to random variability? And the answer is clear: the 0.116 since 1998 is not significantly different from those 0.175 °C per decade since 1979 in this sense. Just look at the confidence intervals. This difference is well within the range expected from the short-term variability found in that time series. (Of course climatologists are also interested in understanding the physical mechanisms behind this short-term variability in global temperature, and a number of studies, including one by Grant Foster and myself, has shown that it is mostly related to El Niño / Southern Oscillation.) There simply has been no statistically significant slowdown, let alone a “pause”.

** Summary from article **
&gt;In summary: that the warming since 1998 “is not significant” is completely irrelevant. This warming is real (in all global surface temperature data sets), and it is factually wrong to claim there has been no warming since 1998. There has been further warming despite the extreme cherry pick of 1998.

&gt;What is relevant, in contrast, is that the warming since 1998 is not significantly less than the long-term warming. So while there has been a slowdown, this slowdown is not significant in the sense that it is not outside of what you expect from time to time due to year-to-year natural variability, which is always present in this time series.

&gt;Given the warm temperature of 2014, we already see the meme emerge in the media that “the warming pause is over”. That is doubly wrong – there never was a significant pause to start with, and of course a single year couldn’t tell us whether there has been a change in trend.

&gt;Just look at Figure 1 or Figure 4 – since the 1970s we simply are in an ongoing global warming trend which is superimposed by short-term natural variability.

That's incorrect. Models predicted a slowdown in surface temperature increase (what you incorrectly refer to as a ""pause""), but in only a small number of cases. When actual data was put in for the simulated PDO/ENSO cycles, the models correctly predicted the slowdown.

A recent experiment demonstrated that, as we already knew, models aren't very good at predicting decadal trends, but also that they are not biased towards being too hot or too cold.

In other words, pointing to the failure of models on time frames they were never designed to be accurate for as evidence that they have failed is quite disingenuous.

&gt; That speech was in 1965. No papers predicting AGW at that time 

Sure there were. Arrhenius first made that prediction, more than a century ago, and was followed by others, including Callendar. From [WP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_climate_change_science):

&gt;*In 1938 a British engineer, Guy Stewart Callendar, attempted to revive Arrhenius's greenhouse-effect theory. Callendar presented evidence that both temperature and the CO
2 level in the atmosphere had been rising over the past half-century, and he argued that newer spectroscopic measurements showed that the gas was effective in absorbing infrared in the atmosphere. Nevertheless, most scientific opinion continued to dispute or ignore the theory.*

By 1965 it was becoming increasingly clear that increased CO2 was warming the globe. Again, from WP:

&gt;**Increasing concern, 1950s - 1960s**

&gt;*Better spectrography in the 1950s showed that CO2 and water vapor absorption lines did not overlap completely. Climatologists also realized that little water vapor was present in the upper atmosphere. Both developments showed that the CO2 greenhouse effect would not be overwhelmed by water vapor.*

&gt;*In 1955 Hans Suess's carbon-14 isotope analysis showed that CO2 released from fossil fuels was not immediately absorbed by the ocean. In 1957, better understanding of ocean chemistry led Roger Revelle to a realization that the ocean surface layer had limited ability to absorb carbon dioxide. By the late 1950s, more scientists were arguing that carbon dioxide emissions could be a problem, with some projecting in 1959 that CO2 would rise 25% by the year 2000, with potentially ""radical"" effects on climate. In 1960 Charles David Keeling demonstrated that the level of CO2 in the atmosphere was in fact rising, as Revelle had predicted. Concern mounted year by year along with the rise of the ""Keeling Curve"" of atmospheric CO2.*

&gt;*Another clue to the nature of climate change came in the mid-1960s from analysis of deep-sea cores by Cesare Emiliani and analysis of ancient corals by Wallace Broecker and collaborators. Rather than four long ice ages, they found a large number of shorter ones in a regular sequence. It appeared that the timing of ice ages was set by the small orbital shifts of the Milankovitch cycles. While the matter remained controversial, some began to suggest that the climate system is sensitive to small changes and can readily be flipped from a stable state into a different one.*

&gt;*Scientists meanwhile began using computers to develop more sophisticated versions of Arrhenius's calculations. In 1967, taking advantage of the ability of digital computers to numerically integrate absorption curves, Syukuro Manabe and Richard Wetherald made the first detailed calculation of the greenhouse effect incorporating convection (the ""Manabe-Wetherald one-dimensional radiative-convective model""). They found that, in the absence of unknown feedbacks such as changes in clouds, a doubling of carbon dioxide from the current level would result in approximately 2 °C increase in global temperature.*

So, as you can see, scientists already knew that CO2 was warming the globe even then.

&gt;LBJ was talking about pollution and nothing else.

What pollution impact does CO2 have outside of warming the atmosphere?

The article itself doesn't say anything that's not true: 

&gt;The findings jibe well with current thinking among climate scientists about how the hydrological cycle is being affected by global warming. In general, as the atmosphere becomes warmer, it can hold more moisture. One consequence of higher water vapor concentrations is more frequent, intense precipitation.

&gt;Villarini says the current study did not attempt to link the increase in the number of episodes to climate change.

&gt;""What causes the observed changes in precipitation and temperature is not something we have addressed because of the difficulties in doing so just based on observational records,"" Villarini says.

I don't disagree with any of this factually, but it's a mistake to extrapolate from ""it's consistent with the model projections"" to ""we have reason to believe that this is climate change"". We simply lack the ability to put much faith in those predictions as yet in the Midwest. Also, while the models (generally) agree that things will get somewhat wetter, they don't say anything at all about the timing and intensity of that rainfall, which is what drives flooding. Midwest summer hydrology is dominated by convective rainfall events, which are not modeled explicitly by the GCMs.

It would be so nice if you people would actually read what you provide as ""proof"", rather than forcing me to do the work for you. The section ""Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide"" is buried in the subpanel reports way down on page 111; well underneath several more important topics *that were in fact referred to specifically in the speech*.  While other topics were dealt with urgently this section is equivocal and makes no firm predictions. The title of section 1 is ""Carbon Dioxide From Fossil Fuels - The Invisible *Pollutant*.   
Some of the salient passages:

&gt;P 113
&gt;The known amounts of limestone and organic carbon in the sediments indicate that the atmospheric carbon dioxide has changed 40.000 times during the past 4 billion years, consequently, the residence time of carbon in the atmosphere, relative to sedimentary rocks, must be on the order of a hundred thousand years.

&gt;That part that remains in the atmosphere may have a significant effect on climate … a strong absorber and back radiator of IR. Particularly in the wavelengths from 12-18 microns; consequently, an increase in CO2 could act … to raise the temperature of the lower air. (Water vapour also absorbs IR, both in the range of the CO2 band, and at … 6.3 microns. With the average concentrations of water vapour in the lower air at mid-latitudes, the effect of CO2 is reduced to about half that which would exist in an absolutely dry atmosphere.

&gt;P 114
&gt;Even today, we cannot make a useful prediction concerning the magnitude or nature of the possible climate effects. 

&gt;P 122
&gt;…G.S.Callender … writing in the late 1930’s and the 1940’s based on the crude data then available, believed that the increase in atmospheric CO2 from 1850 to 1940 was at least 10%. He thought this increase could account quantitatively for the observed warming of northern Europe and northern North America that began in the 1880’s. …we see that the actual CO2 increase in the atmosphere prior to 1940 was only 4%... this was probably insufficient to produce the observed temperature changes. 

&gt;The pronounced warming of the surface air did not continue much beyond 1940… for the world as a whole… there was slight lowering of about 0.1C. Yet during this period more than 40% of the total CO2 increase from fossil fuel combustion occurred. We must conclude that climatic “noise” from other processes has at least partially masked any effects on climate due to past increases in atmospheric CO2 content. 

&gt;P 126 Conclusions
&gt;By the year 2000 the increase in atmospheric CO2 will be close to 25%. This may be sufficient to produce measurable, and perhaps marked changes in climate, and will almost certainly cause significant changes in the temperature and other properties of the stratosphere.  At present it is impossible to predict these effects quantitatively…

There were no alarms being raised at all. The speechwriters simply included all of the items in the report, one of those being CO2. There is nothing listed in the recommendations section concerning climate. 

So, is the claim that LBJ was talking up dangerous climate impacts valid? It is not. Which is what I said in the first place. Of all of the ridiculous things you could seek to argue about, this one ranks high on the list.

There are a few other concerns than rising temperatures (i.e. ocean acidification) from an increase in CO2 in the report, but not much else.

This is an absolutely baffling response. But you seem to be claiming that the the report offers no concerns about CO2, but is only talking about it as an interesting sidenote (""Trees are green! Flowers are pretty! CO2 warms the planet!""). So let's look at that.

&gt; It has sometimes been suggested that atmospheric warming due to an increase in the CO2 content of the atmosphere may result in a catastrophically rapid melting of the Antarctic ice cap, with an accompanying rise in sea level... 

Sound like something you might hear today? 

&gt; The climatic changes that may be produced by the increase CO2 content could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings. The possibilities of deliberately bringing about countervailing climatic changes therefore need to be thoroughly explored. 

So: 

1) Johnson mentions CO2 emissions as a potential concern

2) We know the Johnson administration was aware of the concerns of climate scientists about CO2 emissions impacts on climate

3) There is no other suggested concern he might have been referring to or other suggested reason he might have mentioned CO2

2) At least one of the questions quoted in the Fox article is actually wrong (""Skeptics were also more likely to correctly say that if the North Pole icecap melted, global sea levels would not rise.

4) Kahan's work in the past has focused on the role of political ideology in explaining beliefs, and the fact that as education levels go up people become more entrenched in their ideological beliefs. The whole point of his work is that people don't form their opinions on climate change (or other contentious issues) based on factual information, but rather on their sense of collective identity. This, honestly, is not news (which is no dig at Kahan, this is work he's been doing for years). 

The vast majority of people on both sides of the climate question know very little about the science (which makes sense, since the vast majority of people don't have the time or interest to learn the intricacies of the research), and make their judgements based on heuristics, mostly around political and social affiliation. This has nothing to do with either side being smarter or dumber-  it is, in Kahan's own words:

&gt;the question ""do you believe in human-caused climate change?"" measures something different from climate-science knowledge questions that are worded to avoid threatening survey respondents' cultural identities.

Here's an exerpt: 

&gt;Thus, to say there is “no relationship” between science comprehension and belief in climate
change would definitely be incorrect. There is a very large one. But the nature of it depends on the
test takers’ identities. Those whose cultural commitments predispose them to be concerned about climate
change become even more so as their level of science comprehension increases. Those whose
commitments predispose them to be less concerned become all the more skeptical (Figure 6). Far
from increasing the likelihood that individuals will agree that human activity is causing climate
change, higher science comprehension just makes the response that a person gives to a “globalwarming
belief” item an even more reliable indicator of who he or she is.

He also finds that belief in climate change (overall) increases with ""ordinary science intelligence"", an accepted measure of scientific literacy. This is a much stronger effect than the supposed ""deniers know more than believers"" effect. But that effect is strongly dependent on political ideology. 

Another key pull quote: 

&gt;What is the relationship between OCSI and belief in human-caused climate change? The answer
is that there isn’t any (Figure 12). Those respondents who indicated that they believe the earth is
“getting warmer mostly because of human activity such as burning fossil fuels” scored no better on
the assessment than either ones who identified “natural patterns in the earth’s environment” as the
source of recent global warming or those who indicated they disbelieved the “average temperature on
earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades.”

&gt;This should not come as a surprise. **As indicated, peoples’ answers to whether one “believes in”
human-caused global warming doesn’t measure what they know; it expresses who they are.** The
“believe in” global-warming question was not prefaced by an “according to scientists” or like clause.
Indeed, the lack of any meaningful relationship between OCSI scores and responses to the “belief in”
human-caused global-warming item helps to corroborate that the OCSI scale does indeed succeed in
measuring a form of comprehension independent of test-takers’ cultural identities.

From the same website

&gt; A group of leading climate researchers has identified a fatal flaw in the climate models that leads them to produce triple the global warming predicted from doubling the CO2 in the air.

CO2 in the atmosphere has some warming effect on Earth’s climate, but undisputed science shows that each additional CO2 molecule we emit has less warming effect than all its predecessors already in the air.

&gt; The direct warming effect of doubling the CO2 in the air is generally agreed to be little more than 1 C°. However climate models produce exaggerated warming forecasts by assuming that strongly positive or amplifying temperature feedbacks, such as the increased capacity of warmer air to carry water vapour, a greenhouse gas. They assume that these positive feedbacks will turn 1 C° of direct warming into 3 C° of imagined catastrophe.

They model this assumed feedback with a feedback system-gain equation which is at the heart of every climate model. The equation, however, is borrowed from electronic circuitry. It is not applicable to dynamical systems such as the Earth’s atmosphere.

Which is what I said. The study is too simple to show a more broad difference.

&gt;One can test this with a glass of water and an ice cube – the water level will not change after the ice melts."" - this is actually false)

This is an example of why we know that skeptics are better educated and more intelligent than AGW believers. Ice is expanded water. That's why it floats. Melt the ice and the volume of water does not change. Skeptics have observed for a long time now that believers don't command even the most basic of concepts which leads you guys to defend the most ridiculous ideas. It doesn't help that there are hundreds of blogs applauding both a lack of understanding and a willingness to be led by the nose.

&gt;But the study hasn't been published yet; how do you know what the survey tool was? 

Examples of the mere **5** questions given in the article. Given the ice example above you would have scored lower than an AGW skeptic. The reason we're skeptical of AGW is that we have the intellectual tools needed to identify bullshit. 

I'm quite familiar with Kahan's past work as are most skeptics. His past studies produced multivariate data plots that were only resolved by appeal to statistical weighting. What he came up with was not news; people tend to cluster and opinions tend towards those of the group. No big surprise. It's the outliers that should be of interest. It is after all the outliers who get onto Reddit and oher platforms to make noise in either direction on any issue. The bulk of people who identify themselves pro or con don't have the interest or the competance to offer meaningful opinions.

&gt;Which is almost the polar opposite of what you seem to contend the research states.

Once again, read what I said in my top comment. What I said was (in essence) that this study doesn't come close to describing the level of scientific incompetance of committed AGW believers.

You're wrong, because the arctic sea ice is fresh water while the ocean is salt water. Fresh water is less dense than salt water and thus will raise the water level when it melts. One can test this with a glass of *salt water* and an ice cube. Because the salt water is denser than fresh, the ice floats higher than it would in fresh water.

You're so certain of your correctness that you didn't even bother checking before you said that I ""defend the most ridiculous of ideas"". And that, ultimately, is likely *why* you're wrong, because you're more interested in winning an argument than in being curious.

&gt; What I said was (in essence) that this study doesn't come close to describing the level of scientific incompetance of committed AGW believers.

What this study proves is that scientific competence is not a reliable measure of climate change belief. Scientific competence has a polarizing effect, making those inclined to believe believe more, and those inclined not to believe less. You seen to believe that a closer examination will surely more clearly support your personal beliefs about the greater incompetence of ""committed AGW believers"". I think this is unlikely to be true, but does serve to prove the larger point that people use belief in climate change as a cultural and class marker, rather than having it reflect on their personal scientific understandings.

Yes, it is: you made a false claim, and were called out on it, then tried to claim that wasn't really what you were claiming.

&gt;LBJ made no mention of climate in his speech.

No, but he mentioned CO2, and the only real reason he would mention CO2 is because of its effect on temperatures and the climate.

&gt;LBJ mentioned CO2 exactly once, and in the context of pollution, which is what the speech was warning about.

The only reason CO2 would be brought up is its impact on temperatures. That is why they (and the EPA today) consider an excess of the gas ""pollution.""

&gt;u/fishsticks40 even supplied us with the report that the speech was based on which had as a section title ""CO2 - the invisible pollutant"".

The report also fingered CO2 impact on temperatures as the main issue with it.

One only needs to connect the dot to see that the main reason LBJ was metioning CO2 was because of its effect on temperatures.

&gt;Try this; put the shoe on the other foot. If an article showed up claiming that Hansen were a closet skeptic because at some point in a public speech he mentioned natural variability, you would quite correctly point out how ridiculous that would be.

...except that is completely irrelevant to what interests us. Natural variability *is* a part of climate change, and Hansen already knows this.

Here there is no other reasons to mention CO2 than its effect on temperature (and to a lesser degree ocean acidification).

&gt;Do you actually believe that LBJ wrote that speech himself? Or even that he read the report?

How is that germane to the point?

&gt;Those same people recommend whether or not reports will be made public or buried. If yiou don't understand that then you've never held a job where there's a hierarchy.

That has nothing to do with what we're talking about.

&gt;AGW believers bemoan the fact that acceptance of AGW is dropping among the public. 

Changing the subject, and with a falsehood at that. No, ""acceptance of AGW"" is *not* dropping among the public.

&gt;Defending such obvious and ridiculous lies is one of the reasons.

No one is defending a lie. You appear to be trying to save face after being shown wrong by multiple people.

&gt; If you people exhibited even a tiny amount of objectivity

&gt; there would be more sympathy for the AGW position.

I suggest a ranking of most-to-least credible sources might look like this:

Most credible:
1) Scientific papers published in respected peer-reviewed journals, open to attack by credible scientific peers in the rough-and-tumble of scientific debate
2) Scientific organizations like NASA, NOAA, IPCC
3) The US military's threat assessments (after all, the are professionals at assessing ""risk"")
4) The insurance industry risk assessments (again, professionals at assessing risk)
5) University research programs
6) Scientific journalists, with a strong reputation for honesty

Least:  
6)  Industry or politically-funded think tanks 
7)  Advocacy organizations, like the Sierra Club or Fox News
8)  Advocates posing as scientific journalists, with a weak record for credibility but a long track record of spinning

Well, first, I'd like to iterate the difference between a sound argument and a valid argument. What you've said isn't sound, at all. 

&gt;If A is caused by B, C, D, and E in the past, but A is decreasing, how can you claim that F is now an increasing cause of A? 

Well, if you've broken a leg by falling off the deck 3 times in the past, but then break your leg tomorrow, does that mean we can't conclude you were hit by a car? Of course not. We can't even conclude that you fell off the deck again without sufficient evidence to warrant it. 

Starvation is caused by *something*, as are all consequences. What evidence do you have that such consequences today are caused by the same things today as they were historically? If you look for historical markers, and find no evidence for them, then it is discredited. If you *do* find evidence for another cause, then you look at the other cause.

Which is essentially the position of the study. These are laypeople; what the researcher found was that belief in climate change (anthropogenic) was not a reliable indicator of how much knowledge people have about climate change. 

Frankly this isn't a surprise (which isn't a dig on the study at all, I think it's quite good). People for the most part know what they know, and the basic facts about climate change are out there. But they interpret that knowledge through an ideological lens, and the more knowledge they have the stronger the force of that ideology becomes. 

To quote from [another Kahan article](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2562025): 

&gt;“Motivated reasoning” refers to the tendency of people to conform their assessments of all sorts of evidence to some goal unrelated to accuracy (Sood 2013; Kunda 1990). Students from rival colleges, for example, can be expected to form opposing percep-tions when viewing a film of a disputed officiating call in a football game between their schools, con-sistent with their stake in experiencing emotional solidarity with their peers (Hastorf &amp; Cantril 1954).

&gt;CCT says this same thing occurs when members of the public access information about contest-ed societal risks. When positions on facts become associated with opposing social groups—not universities but rather everyday networks of people linked by common moral values, political outlooks, and social norms—individuals selectively assess evidence in patterns that reflect their group identities (Kahan 2010).","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2w1pyk",1424118075,2015-02-16 20:21:15,"fishsticks40"

Relative to what? You can have multiple opposing forces on a topline variable like ""net food production"", so a net increase doesn't mean that there aren't forces working to depress food production. 

It's also worth mentioning that ""hunger"" is only tangentially related to total global food production; unless you account for food security, distribution, cost, and so forth you're not really solving the problem. Climate change could certainly stress indigenous food systems and cause local famines even while overall production is increasing, increase dependence on global food systems (and the associated lack of food security that goes along with that, though this cuts both ways), and so forth. The fact that we can increase grain production in Canada is cold comfort to people in sub-Saharan Africa who face a choice (to put it generously) between potential droughts and famine, or a further increased dependence on global food systems for subsistence. 

I don't think there are many people who would argue for a return to our preindustrial past and the associated disease and privation; rather that as we move forward we should work to find ways to keep the gains we've made while minimizing the downward forces on quality of life for people across the globe.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2vs2gl",1424118759,2015-02-16 20:32:39,"fishsticks40"

Yes, I very much agree.  That's one of the reasons I so strongly oppose biofuels.  Cropland that could be used as a buffer against famine is being turned into fuel instead.  What we see when there is no reserve capacity is volatile food prices, the upswings of which match riots very well.  See the chart in the following article:

I just explained it to you. Just because operation A caused consequence Y in the past, it does not mean that consequence Y is always from operation A. There is a difference between ""sound"" and ""valid"". Not having evidence for a claim makes the claim unsound, despite it's validity. Saying that the same mechanisms that were responsible for these deaths in the past are causing these deaths today, without providing supporting evidence, is unsound. 

&gt;What? Are you seriously saying that all previous causes have ceased? 

My question is simple: what evidence do you have that the hunger that has been attributed to climate change isn't caused by climate change, but instead caused by the same reasons it was historically? If it were caused by said historical reasons, the same amount of evidence would exist. 

&gt;Are you claiming historical causes have all gone away?

I agree. It's been my experience that the most committed AGW supporters have the least understanding of general principles.

&gt; I think this is unlikely to be true, but does serve to prove the larger point that people use belief in climate change as a cultural and class marker, rather than having it reflect on their personal scientific understandings.

That is debatable of course as well as being subjective. It's a subject I've noted in the past. People can be comfortably grouped into four categories when it comes to AGW. 

1.Those who are up on the latest research and accept AGW on scientific grounds - AGW promoters

2.Those who ae up on the latest research and reject AGW on scientific grounds -AGW skeptics

3.Those who know nothing of the science but accept AGW as that seems to be the way to go based on media reports or their own political views - AGW believers

4.Those who know nothing of the science but reject AGW as that seems to be the way to go based on their own political views - AGW deniers

Of those four groups #3 &amp; #4 are the most numerous, and neither bases their opinions on knowledge of science.

"2127","coo79s1","2","0","t1_coo5rgv","&gt; &gt;You're wrong, because the arctic sea ice is fresh water while the ocean is salt water. Fresh water is less dense than salt water and thus will raise the water level when it melts. One can test this with a glass of salt water and an ice cube. Because the salt water is denser than fresh, the ice floats higher than it would in fresh water.

&gt; That is just ridiculous. The ice comes from the water, whether salt or fresh. Melting returns the same amount of water.

Ridiculous or not, it's true. Did you even follow the link I offered? Sea ice is (basically) fresh, due to the phenomenon referred to as brine rejection. Sea water is salt. Salt water is denser than fresh water, so a fresh water cube floats higher in salt water than it would in fresh water. It's a fact. So the melting of sea ice *will* raise sea levels - not nearly as much as melting land ice, but it will. 

You want to be up on the latest research? Ok!

The mainstream consensus is that it will have severe negative impacts. Some could qualify these impacts as ""catastrophic"", but barring a precise definition of the word it is not useful terminology.

Basically, AGW deniers use the word ""catastrophic"" to make people who accept the consensus seem unnecessarily alarmist. It is politics, a rhetorical trick, and has nothing to do with science.

Would the collapse of our global economy be a catastrophe? Sure, but then again so would be a mass extinction event.

I simply won't allow the public space here to be a pile-on about how I should do this or that.  If there is a comment or article that is inappropriate, the way to handle that is to report it, then use modmail to explain what is wrong with it.

Disingenuity is something that both sides accuse the other of.  I've been there myself, and extensively, with at least one regular here.

I have no doubt that that's true.  My goal is to demonstrate good faith over time.  That does not include taking abuse from anonymous alt accounts.  I'll politely discuss anything with anyone using their regular account over PM or modmail, but I won't kowtow to anonymous drive-by bullying.

They only get silenced if they are unwilling to be civil.  Civility is not that hard to do.  Knowledgeable people know that.

If you don't like what people submit, either report it and tell me why it shouldn't be here, or do what others have done here: explain what's wrong with it.  That's what civil discussion is all about.  If something really isn't scientific, you are doing everyone a favor by explaining why it isn't scientific.  Believe it or not, you can gain a lot of respect from your opponent by explaining politely why their submission is wrong.

&gt;But you're going about it all wrong.

So anonymous trolls tell me.  You'll understand when I don't put much stock in their opinion.  If you have suggestions on how I can improve, the appropriate place to do it is via PM or modmail.  

&gt;You're doing to this sub what /u/silence7 did to /r/climate.

Absolutely not, and you know it.  I have not disappeared for months at a time.  I have made an honest effort to facilitate real discussion.

I get it.  You think I'm trying to stifle dissent.  That's fine.  It just happens that the culprits are ""non-believers"".  They're also arrogant, flippant, and prone to gross misinterpretations.  You think my grievance stems from the former.  I can assure you in a thousand different ways it stems from the latter, and the linkage between the two is tangential to the overall problem, but I don't think it'll matter.

I really hope you can somehow, deep down, realize that there's a difference between silencing users who *disagree* and silencing (or at **least** rebuking) users who *are just plain wrong*, over and over again, and who show no sign that they have any interest in adjusting their tact.

So maybe I'm missing something.  Do you think the two people you've named are doing something wrong here?  Let's take the conversations you linked to.  In one of them, there was discussion of RSS data versus GISS/HadCRUT data.  Was that inappropriate, or did I read the wrong part?

&gt;Will, this comment is still unedited. And the user even doubled down.

Thanks for pointing that out.  The user is now banned.

&gt;If I said, in reference to you accusation that I'm in any way not contributing to civil discussion, ""Would you care to revise yours?"", would that help? Would you receive that retort well? 

You said I was only moderating in favor of people who agree with me, which is odd since I'm about as centrist on this issue as one gets.  I linked my most recent comments warning people.  Three of the four were to people you think are on my ""side"" for some reason.  I then asked if you want to revise your accusation, **based on that data**.  There's nothing wrong with that.  If you provided me with information and asked me if I wanted to revised an accusation **based on that data**, I would find nothing wrong with that.  So let me try again.  Do you maintain that I'm moderating in a one-sided fashion given that I've been issuing warnings to those opposite your position on the climate change issue?

&gt;I stand by the fact that I've reported several comments and posts. 

Have you PM'd or modmailed me in conjunction with those reports?  Have you noticed that I have replied to comments you've reported, asking for revisions?  Have you noted that I've actually removed some reported posts?

&gt;Never received a single response, unfortunately

How could you if you don't PM or use modmail?  Again I'll ask:

- Have you noticed that I have replied to comments you've reported, asking for revisions?  

- Have you noted that I've actually removed some reported posts?

So please don't tell me I have not done anything when in fact I have and continue to do things.

&gt;They're also arrogant, flippant, and prone to gross misinterpretations.

I assure you, all those traits exist in great quantities on both sides.  I'm not moderating for those, else there would be no one left to comment here, including myself.  Who hasn't been flippant from time to time?

&gt; I don't have anything more to say except the fact that it's a running theme here over the past few weeks

You know what else is common?  People you are turning a blind eye to behaving just as badly.  As much as I want civility, I will not micromanage every conversation.  A bridge is what I seek, but it will only come with time.

&gt;and I'm not the only one commenting on it.

Not a solitary soul has PM'd me or contacted me via modmail to discuss any of these issues.

&gt;there's a difference between silencing users who disagree and silencing (or at least rebuking) users who are just plain wrong

This is where I'm hoping civil discussion can lead to enlightenment.  If you want a great example of this, look at how /u/nimbuscile deals with people.  It isn't the moderators' role in *any* subreddit to tell people they are factually wrong.  It is my role to try to keep lines of communication open in such a way that discussion can enlighten.

&gt;You can enforce stringent standards for the science as easily as you can enforce standards for the discourse.

Would you like me to do that?  I'm asking in all sincerity.  I've described my role here, but if you want me to enforce science standards, I'll give it a try.  That means I'll remove about 90% of the material submitted here.  I'll remove the majority of comments as well.  Is that the type of sub you are looking for?

Looking at the graph, Greenland warmed by 8°C over a period of 20,000 years, which is 0.04°C/100yrs. Our current warming is about 0.8°C/100yrs, which is 20 times as fast. Hardly less dramatic.

Reading a thermometer provides a direct information measured in degrees C/F or in Kelvins. The measuring tools on the satellites do not provide direct measurements of degrees C/F or Kelvins, but information that needs to be processed (and adjusted for things such as orbital drift). They are much less direct, and thus saying they are ""inferred"" as opposed to directly measured seems more accurate. I used the term because that's what they used on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_temperature_measurements), which also provides a bit more details (with references):

&gt;*Satellites do not measure temperature. They measure radiances in various wavelength bands, which must then be mathematically inverted to obtain indirect inferences of temperature.

So, it seems the two methods are distinct enough that one can be considered ""direct"" while the other one is ""inferred"". That doesn't make one better than the other.

Another way to see it: the thermometer gives you temperature, and only temperature. It doesn't provide any other type of information. The sensors on board the satellites provide readings that can then be used to determine multiple types of information, one of them being temperature.

From the Remote Sensing Systems site, which you obviously haven't read yet:

&gt;*The brightness temperature is a measurement of the radiance of the microwave radiation traveling upward from the top of the atmosphere to the satellite, expressed in units of the temperature of an equivalent black body.  The brightness temperature (or TB ) is the fundamental parameter measured by passive microwave radiometers.  The brightness temperatures measured at different microwave frequencies  are used at Remote Sensing Systems to derive wind, vapor, cloud, rain, and SST products.*

The [Data Processing section of the Wikipedia page for RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_sensing#Data_processing) also provides a lot of information in one place:

&gt;*Generally speaking, remote sensing works on the principle of the inverse problem. While the object or phenomenon of interest (the state) may not be directly measured, there exists some other variable that can be detected and measured (the observation), which may be related to the object of interest through the use of a data-derived computer model. The common analogy given to describe this is trying to determine the type of animal from its footprints. For example, while it is impossible to directly measure temperatures in the upper atmosphere, it is possible to measure the spectral emissions from a known chemical species (such as carbon dioxide) in that region. The frequency of the emission may then be related to the temperature in that region via various thermodynamic relations.*

Hopefully this helps make the distinction clearer for you.

No. Why would I do that?

&gt;2) You also said that satellite readings are calibrated (using existing measurements, i.e, premeasured). It's the same thing.

Not really. I suspect (though do not know for sure) that the results of satellite measurements were compared to ground measurements at some point in order to assess their accuracy. I could be wrong, and if indeed I am I'll be happy to acknowledge it. That said, it does not mean that it is the same thing. It is *not* the same thing. Even the RSS people say they cannot directly measure the atmosphere. This implies that you can directly measure the temperature of things.

Again, if you want to say that no direct measurement of temperature is possible, then be my guest, but to me that is arguing semantics.

It's not just more robust, it's a completely different process then a direct effect of temperature on the volume of mercury in a glass tube.

Since you seem unfamiliar with the actual process, I suggest you read [RSS's description of how they derive temperatures from the actual measurements](http://www.remss.com/measurements/brightness-temperature).

Um... What? 

&gt;&gt;C) Some 120 years ago scientists theorized that human emissions of CO2 could potentially cause the globe to warm.

&gt;C. hypothesis

Seriously? [This is in the published literature.](http://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_tcm18-173546.pdf) I'm not sure what you think a ""hypothesis"" is. If I claimed that Mark Twain wrote a book called ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" that that would be a hypothesis too? Pay particular attention to section IV (""*Calculation of the Cariation of Temperature that would ensue in consequence of a given Variation of the Carbonic Acid in the Air*""), in which Arrhenius calculates that a doubling of CO2 would lead to a mean temperature increase of around 3C - remarkably close to the current estimate of 3.7.

The only way to prove this false would be to provide an alternate explanation, which you have failed to do. Go ahead, provide a link to a physical model which reproduces the observed temperature record and paleorecord better than existing climate models but which doesn't require CO2 forcing to do it. Spoiler alert: it doesn't exist. 

&gt;conclusion: There is more to warming than just Co2.

Well duh. Do you think climate scientists don't know this? Do you think that things like solar intensity, volcanic activity, aerosols (including human-created), ozone depletion, and so forth, aren't accounted for in the models? 

Again, it's simple. Provide a physical model that recreates the observed trends as well or better than existing models without the influence of anthropogenic CO2. Go for it. You'll be rich and famous.

&gt;*Overview*

&gt;*The brightness temperature is a measurement of the radiance of the microwave radiation traveling upward from the top of the atmosphere to the satellite, expressed in units of the temperature of an equivalent black body.  The brightness temperature (or TB ) is the fundamental parameter measured by passive microwave radiometers.  The brightness temperatures, measured at different microwave frequencies, are used at Remote Sensing Systems to derive wind, vapor, cloud, rain, and SST products. Despite differences in sensor frequencies, channel resolutions, instrument operation and other radiometer characteristics, RSS produces high-quality, carefully intercalibrated data,using uniform processing techniques, with a brightness temperature data record spanning multiple instruments over several decades. At the bottom of this page, we include information on access to our brightness temperature data and links to more detailed information.*","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2wbj06",1424323607,2015-02-19 05:26:47,"archiesteel"

"2236","coq65j8","5","0","t3_2w9z2c","I didn't realise this had been cross-posted here, but here's what I wrote on the same post on /r/climateskeptics (**TL;DR** - The paper doesn't present any new information on East Antarctic Temperature nor the relationship to the stability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet):

First, to address some important issues:

1. Climate of the Past is an open access journal, and it makes the original submitted articles and reviewer comments (the 'discussion') fully open access as well. This means that 'discussion papers' (such as this one) haven't made it through peer-review yet and so the findings could, or could not, be correct and significant. Calling this a 'new paper' as the blogger did here is a bit of a gamble.

2. Temperatures in Antarctica are derived from isotopic d18O and dD measurements*. Whilst these are physically and empirically shown to correlate well with temperature, they are not perfect due to change in the moisture sources and trajectories of precipitation. So using exact temperature in this sense is also pretty risky (there are some more interesting attempts being used in Greenland to quantify exact past temperatures, and I assume they will soon be applied to the Antartic ice cores as well). But, I digress.

To my understanding of this paper: This study uses two distinct and different ice cores, Dome C (EDC) and Dome Fuji (EDF), which lie on the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS), but quite a distance apart (see Figure 1 in paper). Since the chronologies for the cores are synchronised via dating of volcanic events, comparison of the time intervals between stratigraphic horizons can act as an indicator for past **relative** surface mass balance (SMB, i.e.e gain or loss of ice) from the two regions. I put the word relative in bold, as it is really telling us about the differences between the two regions as opposed to quantitative SMB for the whole EAIS (which is why the authors use a SMB ratio).

Its an interesting approach, but the authors note that ""the isotope-based SMB at either EDC or DF or both are associated with relative uncertainties of the order of 10 % at minimum, possibly more with correlated errors which cannot be detected using our synchronization method"", which doesn't give terrible confidence in the results. But ignoring that, the results of this study only describe relative changes between the two cores, and find that during the last and current interglacial changes in SMB at both sites were relatively similar (SMB ratio of approx 1), but the SMB ratio was much more different during glacial periods. In laymens terms, what it is saying is that past climate changes didn't affect the whole EAIS in the same way, some areas gained/lost ice much faster than others, though during interglacial periods ice gain and loss was more homogenous throughout Antarctica. I can't find any support for any theory suggesting this was a period of general stability of the EAIS, as the paper doesn't touch on that issue at all. It also doesn't talk at all about the relationship between EAIS stability and temperature - we already know that the majority of the EAIS survived through the late Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles when Temperature could have been a few degrees higher, so this doesn't change our thinking in that sense at all. Bear in mind that sea levels were (likely) 6-7m higher than today in the last interglacial, so at least some of the ice either in Greenland or the Antarctic must have contributed to that.



*Edit to add: The 'temperatures' presented by this paper are not new, they have been published and widely available since 2007. The authors only use them for comparison with their SMB reconstructions.

Reconstructing past temperature is a real challenge, and scientists have used some clever methods to do it.  Some have taken to using journal entries, ships' log, etc. to identify growing seasons, occurrences of frost, etc. to identify trends.  What's nice about this approach is that it can verify specific anomalies like 1816, the year without a summer, that was likely caused by the eruption of Mount Tambora the previous year.

The most common approach, though, is to use proxy data.  There are many sorts of proxy data that can be used.  Tree rings spring to mind, but there are all sorts.  Sediments at the bottom of lakes.  Elements present in ice cores.  Elements present in land soil samples even.  Sea levels from previous interglacials.  (This one, obviously, only shows interglacials warmer than the present one.)  Locations of fossils by species.  All sorts of things.

Scientists are pretty good at pointing out the error margins when using proxy data.  They look for multiple lines of evidence.  Unfortunately, the media isn't too good at understanding statistics, so they'll report a given proxy as though it were a thermometer reading.

Even in the modern day, establishing temperatures is more difficult than one might think.  We have surface records going back a couple hundred years in a very few locations, but the number of surface stations really only became substantial during the last century.  Even then, urbanization has encroached on existing stations.  There were stations that were far from towns when they were first set up that are now literally surrounded by asphalt.  So those stations' data must be corrected using various homogenization algorithms and the like.  

Atmospheric temperature data was really spotty before the late 1970s.  Prior to that, we relied on radiosonde data from weather balloons.  After that time we have satellite data which gives us measurements of IR for the various atmospheric layers.

Ocean temperature data was very poor until the 1950s, and quite poor until the ARGO project was created in the last decade or two.  There are buoys spread around the ocean that dive to several hundred, maybe a couple of thousand, meters; they then return and report.

So I don't know that I've answered your question in full.  I hope I've given you, in broad strokes, some of the approaches scientists have taken to reconstruct past temperatures.

They clearly are not.  Some say the Medieval Warm Period (MWP; aka Medieval Climate Anomaly, MCA) was warmer than today.  It's clear that it was certainly warmer in some locations, particularly Northern Europe, but most climate scientists think that globally it was not.  Going back further, the Holocene Climatic Optimum (HCO) was warmer than today.  The interglacial just prior to this one was warmer than the present one.  This is generally acknowledged in the scientific community.

The more interesting question has to do with warming rates.  Was the 0.7-0.8°C warming observed during the previous century unprecedented?  One would probably have to go back to the transition from glacial to interglacial 10-15,000 years ago to find something similar. 

More interesting still is the question of whether the present rate of warming will persist or accelerate, and if so, for how long.  That's where the real debate lies, in my opinion, and it's a tough one because we must delve into not just trying to figure out all the causes of warming during the past century, both natural and anthropogenic, but see if we can figure out climatic feedbacks, both positive and negative.

"2251","coqq35q","5","0","t3_2wg768","/u/Will_Power's summary of climate measurement is excellent, so I won't go into that here. Instead I'm going to talk about the 'hard data' that science requires.

Studies of human-caused climate change don't just depend on observations of the climate state. They're an important part, but not the only one. Here are two of the 'basic physics' points on which climate change theory rests:

* Earth warms and cools through changes in its energy balance. This is just the first law of thermodynamics - established well before we had comprehensive measurements of the Earth's climate.

* CO2 absorbs infrared radiation, reducing Earth's rate of emission of energy to space. This was measured in a laboratory by John Tyndall in 1861.

Now, these two things are scientific facts, and only nutjobs dispute this kind of stuff. The real question is how sensitive Earth's temperature is to an energy imbalance, whether caused by CO2 or some other factor. Our estimates of this depend on the size of climate feedbacks, and our uncertainty range on these estimates are still about as broad as they have always been. 1.5 - 4.5 degrees C per doubling of CO2 is the current best estimate.

So parts of climate change theory don't directly rest on comprehensive data on past climates. However, such data greatly improve our understanding of climate processes and help us get a handle on those feedbacks I mentioned.

Finally, and crucially, the temperatures don't have to be 'unprecedented' to prove anything. We know most of the warming since pre-industrial times has been due to human-emitted greenhouse gases because:

1. We have observed an increase in greenhouse gas concentrations (uncontroversial).

2. We know greenhouse gases reduce Earth's emission of energy and can calculate the effect on the energy imbalance they have had (uncontroversial).

3. We have no other plausible driver of an energy imbalance to account for the observed warming (pretty uncontroversial, but uncertainty in the estimates of the relative sizes of different drivers do have an effect - especially aerosols).

Unfortunately, nothing I've described tells us in a straightforward fashion what might happen in the future. For that we have to delve deeper into the physical phenomena of the climate system and characterise climate processes and climate feedbacks. For that we absolutely need good observational data. Things are getting pretty exciting in terms of observations now, I think. We have some very long-term records, but we are also getting new satellite instruments capable of observations of astounding quality.

Hope that's useful!

&gt;__[Carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide)__ (CO
2) is an important long-lived trace gas in __[Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth)__ currently constituting about 0.04% (400 parts per million) of the atmosphere. Despite its relatively small overall concentration, CO
2 is a potent [greenhouse gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas) and plays a vital role in regulating [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)'s surface temperature through [radiative forcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing) and the [greenhouse effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect): CO
2 absorbs and emits [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared) radiation at [wavelengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength) of 4.26 [µm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9Cm) (asymmetric stretching [vibrational mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy)) and 14.99 µm (bending vibrational mode).

The fresh watter ice is frozen out of the sea water. When it melts it remains water. It doesn't change its mass. 

- Take 2 cubic feet of sea water in a contianer 
- freeze it such that 1 cubic foot is frozen
- the total volume is now greater because ice crystalizes and in the process expands. Due to the same mass taking up a greater space it's lighter per cubic foot than the water, so it floats. it will float somewhat higher in salt water than in fresh.
- thaw the ice and we still have 2 cubic feet of water.

In his experimental procedure Noerdinger heated the water.That's what increased the volume. That result is echoed by Jenkins in his summary:

- ""When floating ice melts in the ocean the effective mass of the ocean remains unchanged, but there is a change in its mean density. Both the change in temperature and the change in salinity shown in Figure 3 must be considered when calculating the steric sea level rise (or fall) associated with this density change. If the ocean is subsequently returned to its original temperature through heat exchange with the atmosphere, a further rise in sea level will accompany the warming, leaving the freshening as the only lasting impact of the ice. ""

AGW skeptics nave been saying for years that the main cause of sea level rise is thermal expansion.

Wait - really? *That's* your argument? Of course there's no change between the states (no sea ice) and (no sea ice). Similarly if you compared the sea levels with no Antarctic land ice to the levels with no Antarctic land they'd, um, be the same. I'm not arguing that if you kept refreezing and thawing your bucket of water the water would slowly expand to fill the universe.

I'm saying that the free surface of the liquid water would be lower *during the partially frozen phase*.

And no, thermal expansion doesn't account for Noerdinger's result; the water in the cylinder was at roughly the same temperature during both measurements, and the coefficient of thermal expansion is well understood. Nor is it due to freshening, something they confirmed with an experimental control. I'll agree they should have repeated the experiment in fresh water just to stress the point.

This is Archimedes' principle at work. It's not that hard to understand. A fresh water ice cube floats higher in salt water than in fresh, but takes the same volume in both once it melts. 

&gt; asking them to think about an issue is a waste of time.

Well you've demonstrated that in spades. Do the math. The actual math. The equation is in the Jenkens article.

And since you seem to like that article:

&gt; Subsequent melting simply replaces the mass of seawater, which has already been displaced by the ice, with an identical mass of meltwater. Since the total mass of the ocean and ice remains unchanged during the melting process, this has often led to the erroneous assumption that sea level will be unaffected by the melting of floating ice.

&gt; In fact melting causes a change in the ocean density, and hence its volume, while leaving the total mass unaltered (Figure 1). Consider a mass of floating ice simply converted to freshwater without any mixing with the surrounding ocean. The freshwater displaces the same mass of seawater as the ice did, but since its density is lower than that of the ocean it still has a freeboard, which will now be seen by an observer as a rise in the mean sea level. Subsequent mixing of the seawater and freshwater will have only a small impact, which we will ignore for the moment, on their total volume, since the density of seawater is a nearly linear function of its salinity, and that function is approximately independent of temperature. Following complete mixing there will be a net freshening of the ocean and thus a steric sea level rise is associated with the conversion of floating ice to meltwater.

&gt; The effects are quite small (the freeboard in Figure 1b is only 2–3% of the volume of the displaced ocean water), but they are not totally insignificant when compared with the magnitude of the quoted error on current estimates of sea level rise 

Sorry, protest all you want, but the melting of *existing* floating ice has a nonzero impact on sea levels.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2vq2bz",1424442918,2015-02-20 14:35:18,"fishsticks40"

&gt;Oh my goodness, you're pulling an archie. That makes no sense at all.


You're comparing the water level ***before the ice is frozen to the water level after the ice has melted***. Of course they're the same. My example (land ice) was deliberately ridiculous, your example appears to have been inadvertently ridiculous. They represent the same thinking, though - comparing an ice-free state to an ice-free state and remarking that they're the same. 

&gt;&gt;I'm saying that the free surface of the liquid water would be lower during the partially frozen phase.

&gt;What is ""partially frozen"" water?

While what I mean here is patently obvious I'll spell it out using small words - I don't refer to ""partially frozen water"" I refer to the ""partially frozen *phase*"" of your proposed experiment, where half the volume (really should be mass, but we'll let that slide, since in both cases the frozen mass is the same) is frozen. Half meaning partial. 

You actually say it yourself: 

&gt;it will float somewhat higher in salt water than in fresh.

Yes! Yes, the same mass of ice will float somewhat higher in salt water than in fresh, meaning that the *same mass of ice displaces somewhat less volume of salt water than it would of fresh water*. Which is exactly the point. Melting ice in a glass of fresh water doesn't raise the water level because the ice displaces a volume of fresh water that's precisely equal to the volume it will fill once it melts. Melting ice in a glass of salt water displaces a volume of salt water that's slightly less than the volume it will fill once it melts. 

&gt;That quote is ridiculous as well. When the ice forms the salt remains behind. When the ice melts it mixes again. The net is a wash. 

We're not comparing the pre-frozen state to the post-melting state, which is what you seem to think is happening. We're comparing the state *with ice* to the state without ice. And as you acknowledged, the same amount of ice will float higher (and thus displace less volume) in salt water than in fresh. 

&gt; The papers you've cited are meant as a response to the septic observation that the prediction of sea level rise due to arctic melting is untenable. 

You've got the history wrong. The assumption within the climate community has been that sea ice would not impact sea level. These papers are not directed at ""septics"" but at scientists. 

&gt; AGW is lousy with such papers attempting to show that previously accepted science that refutes AGW is wrong.

Please provide an example. Given that you haven't shown any understanding of the papers provided I don't believe that you have any ability to make this statement. 

&gt;The Noerdinger experiment is ridiculous. It's a heated sample and ""roughly"" doesn't count anyway.

In this case ""roughly"" does just fine, because we know the coefficient of thermal expansion of water, we know how sensitive it would be, and it's orders of magnitude smaller than the observed effect. You might as well attribute the change to tidal effects. 

The first measurement was taken when the ice was just dropped in, with the water at room temperature. The second one was taken after the ice had melted and the water *had returned to room temperature*. The fact that heat was applied to make the ice melt faster (""a heated sample"") has no impact.

As for computing power - modelers are well aware of what their models can and can't say. There are thousands of people who, unlike Essex, have devoted their lives to understanding the intricacies of computer modeling. Without computer modeling, without the Navier-Stokes equations, we wouldn't be able to design modern airplanes, or cars, or nuclear power plants, or sewer systems, or any of the many thousands of other things you use in your daily life that function just fine because the models that designed them function just fine. Not perfectly, but well enough. We do statistical modeling of chaotic systems all the time; this is why we talk about ""projections"" rather than ""predictions"" and why we attempt to assign probabilities to a range of particular futures rather than say one or another is the ""correct"" solution. I have a hard time believing Essex is unable to understand this, so I have to imagine that he's not acting in good faith; but I could be wrong and he could simply be woefully ignorant. But starting with his misrepresentation of the IPCC quote 

&gt; In climate research and modelling, we should recognise that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.

Did you read that before hitting ""submit""?

&gt;While what I mean here is patently obvious I'll spell it out using small words - I don't refer to ""partially frozen water"" I refer to the ""partially frozen phase"" of your proposed experiment, where half the volume (really should be mass, but we'll let that slide, since in both cases the frozen mass is the same) is frozen. Half meaning partial. 

No, no, no. There's no way you can turn that back on me. Take a look at the context of what you wrote. If you meant something else then you should have caught it before submitting. Typos we overlook but sentances need to say what we mean. 

&gt;We're not comparing the **pre-frozen state to the post-melting state**, which is what you seem to think is happening. We're comparing the **state with ice to the state without ice**. And as you acknowledged, the same amount of ice will float higher (and thus displace less volume) in salt water than in fresh. 

That's what we call ""pulling an archie"". Essentially the same approach as asking a thousand monkeys to hit keys at random in hopes of reproducing Shakespeare. In this case you're hoping that something meaningful will leap off the page and somehow resolve this mess for you. 
 
The ice is formed from the water. It doesn't arrive from some exotic local. When it melts it rejoins the water. I don't see what problem you have with that. 

&gt;You've got the history wrong.

No I have not. Sea ice melt leading to rising ocean levels was put up as another consequence of climate change. Read the introduction to the Noerdinger paper. He's trying to save the community face by coming up with an explanation as to why the prediction was right in the first place. What you're doing here is another ""archie"" - where you're trying to alter the history of AGW claims in order to get out of a corner. I've been at this a while and i've seen all of the tricks.

[Here's another guy making the same case as you](http://moregrumbinescience.blogspot.ca/2009/04/ice-and-sea-level.html). Take a look at the very first line.

&gt;Please provide an example.

Sure. The claim that natural global climate cycles (LIA, MWP, etc) did not in fact take place. 

&gt;In this case ""roughly"" does just fine, because we know the coefficient of thermal expansion of water, we know how sensitive it would be, and it's orders of magnitude smaller than the observed effect. You might as well attribute the change to tidal effects. 

The guy observed a difference between water levels. To insist that the observation has anything to do other than with thermal expansion is preposterous. The material in the beaker remains constant regardless of state. What salt was expelled as the ice formed remained in the beaker. Preservation of mass through change of state is accepted science.

To imply by omission that an increase of surface ice in the Antarctic is a pertinent factor in refuting the existence of global warming is at best merely being sneaky and frankly dishonest.

Where do you mention that as land ice in Antarctica melts it dilutes the salty surface water allowing for a wider but shallower temporary ice to form. There is great concern in the scientific community that subsurface layers of ice nearest to the surface of the ground upon which the ice rests are becoming liquified and acting as a 'grease' to reduce friction of the ice mass above causing it to flow seaward faster.

 Standing open water on the surface of the Antarctic Ice Cap was detected by satellite during the summer months which melts through cracks and adds to this sub ice melt water. Also there has been serious concern over undersea warming which is eroding the lowest portions of peripheral ice shelves which at present rest upon the sea bed but which may become 'detached' from the support of the land and float/ break off. Antarctic ice shelves have broken off already which was a big surprise to scientists who had thought Antarctica immune from warming (safe for a thousand years they had estimated).

It seems that an increase of thin new ice is to be expected when there is an increase of fresh water on the sea's surface that is coming off the melting land ice.

Climate theory is open to question. There are a great many open questions.

In order to create their case they've decided that (depending on the presenter and the question) natural climate cycles have not occured at all or that they were regional in nature. The latter case is even more problematic than the former given that the current AGW hypothesis insists that small changes ampify through feedbacks. How then do they justify believing that a local change in climate lasting hundreds of years can have no effect on the globe? AGW is built on contradictions and denial of previous observations. 

We know that throughout the period we can measure with some accuracy that global temperatures have cycled between warm and cool periods.

Nor, I'm guessing, would he say that - this is clearly a side project and not a matter of great import. It is, however, *true* - his math is simple and unassailable. You have yet to explain why you think his math is wrong, or even to show that you really understand it. 

Nor, frankly, does the number of citations have much bearing on the truth of a paper. But [that](http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/imarusic/proceedings/18/321%20-%20Gwyther.pdf) doesn't [mean](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2007GL030784/full) your [claim](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010GL042496/references) isn't [bullshit](http://www.ltu.se/cms_fs/1.5035!/nordell-gervet%20ijgw.pdf).  

&gt;Even archie has not jumped into this thread. If he's not willing to defend a pro-AGW study then you know it's obvious crap.

You seem obsessed with /u/archiesteel. I'm not sure that's healthy. But honestly - this isn't even a ""pro-AGW"" study. This is a simple light paper explaining pretty simple physics that had been overlooked before. This paper doesn't provide any additional evidence that AGW is true (not that any more is needed); it simply discusses what the impact of melting sea ice would be on water levels, and how, while it is small, it is non-zero. That's all it claims to show, and it shows it successfully. The fact that you don't understand it (or more likely that you're invested in not believing it) is irrelevant. 

&gt; That's utterly wrong. We know that the arctic region has seen periods where it was nearly ice free many times even in the historic period. We have evidence from biology (stomata analysis), anthropology (artifacts and population movement), and from modern historical records.

Oh do go on. Please provide citations for stomatal  and anthropological data that show that the north pole (which, BTW, is in the ocean, where there are remarkably few people and plants don't have stomata (not that there are complex aquatic plants at the north pole anyway). It is possible that the arctic was ice free during the Holocene Thermal Maximum, but I'm not aware of any data that shows this conclusively (perhaps you are, in which case please share it). It almost certainly was during the last interglacial, around 125 Ka, based on plankton in the sediments from that time. Interestingly, sea level was some 4-6 meters higher then than today, though the melted sea ice would only be responsible for a few centimeters of that.

It wasn't. The graph you linked to references Pacific ocean temperatures. And it's true, ocean temperatures and patterns showed the typical signs of an El Nino. However an El Nino year isn't marked by ocean indicators alone, but by ocean and atmospheric indicators. 

This year, everyone was pretty sure that we'd have an El Nino [based on the ocean patterns](http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2014/08/climate-scientists-dub-this-year’s-el-nino-a-real-enigma/), but the atmosphere [failed to ever respond](http://www.vox.com/2014/11/8/7177709/el-nino-2014-forecast-weakening), meaning [2014 was not an El Nino year.](http://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/en-so) If it was, we should've seen a ton of rainfall in California and a warm, mild winter on the east coast (among other signs). Just take one look at the news and it's clear that the exact opposite happened. We still have chronic draught in California, and the east coast is having one of the coldest, harshest winters on record.

I don't understand why you're re-linking to NOAA's charts that NOAA used to specifically say ""this is why we should see El Nino, but here's why we actually aren't seeing El Nino."" Or in their specific words: *""all of which says we’re still waiting for the atmosphere to get dressed in its El Niño clothes and come out to play.""*

&gt;it's not official until NOAA declares it so? Odd.

NOAA is one of the leading scientific agencies in the world, employing some of the most qualified, experienced, and educated scientists in the field today who use some of the most advanced equipment and computing power ever made. Why on earth is it odd that they would know what El Nino looks like? 

And furthermore, it seems like you're implying that they're lying for some reason. If they were to lie about 2014 being an El Nino year (not really sure why they would do this at all), why would they begin by saying they were expecting an El Nino (90% prediction in early 2014), and then just keep downgrading the probability? Why not just say from the start ""we do not expect an El Nino this year."" Then why would they release a whole lot of information about why we *should* be seeing an El Nino year, and why we aren't? Why not just say ""there are no indications of El Nino conditions?"" Would some power-hungry organization admit their initial predictions were wrong just to maintain a farce? 

And that still doesn't address the fact that, if 2014 were an El Nino year, we should've seen very different conditions in California, the East coast, New Zealand, Australia, Southeast Asia, and many more regions.

&gt; [CO2] turnover time is **only about four years** because of the rapid exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean and terrestrial biota. However, a large part of that CO2 is returned to the atmosphere within a few years. Thus, the adjustment time of CO2 in the atmosphere is actually determined by the rate of removal of carbon from the surface layer of the oceans into its deeper layers. Although an approximate value of 100 years may be given for the adjustment time of CO2 in the atmosphere, the actual adjustment is faster initially and slower later on.

But that's probably different from what they used to say, as they had to change their story to deflect criticism from ""skeptics"", right? Let's look at the first assessment report (1990):

&gt;The turnover [residence] time of CO2 in the atmosphere, measured as the ratio of the content to the fluxes through it, **is about 4 years**.  This means that on average it takes only a few years before a CO2 molecule in the atmosphere is taken up by plants or dissolved in the ocean.  This short timescale must not be confused with the time it takes for the atmospheric CO2 level to adjust to a new equilibrium if sources or sinks change.  This adjustment time, corresponding to the lifetime in table 1.1 is of the order 50-200 years, determined mainly by the low exchange of of carbon between surface waters and deep the ocean,  The adjustment time is important for the discussion on global warming potential, c.f. Section 2.2.7"". 

Funny too that they ignore the work of others like say Plass (1956):

&gt;Thus  it  appears that most  of  the  additional  CO2 that  is  released into  the  atmosphere  will  stay  there  for  at least  several  centuries.

Why is the IPCC lying to us and using a 4 year residence time when other literature says it's hundreds?!

They're not lying, of course, and neither are the original papers (though things have been significantly improved since the 60's). They're talking about two different things; one is the residence time of an individual molecule in the atmosphere, and the other is the time for a molecule to leave the equilibrated ocean-atmosphere system. 

When you see a result that seems this out of line, you should be very suspicious. You can disagree with the IPCC's findings, but everything they've done is very well documented and draws directly from the scientific literature.

An early IPCC claim was that even if humans stopped all CO2 production immediately, the warming impact would continue for 100 years; the theoretical “residency time” for a CO2 molecule in the atmosphere. It was designed to increase the pressure for immediate political action. This seems like a specious point, considering the massive limitations identified by Essex, but it is more important because the public understand it. The IPCC know the public won’t understand the science, but they will recoil at the idea that the damage will last 100 years.

They had to recant because they got caught.

I think we can also agree that climate change is mandatory and has been happening long before humans pumped 6% more C02 into the atmosphere yes?

So having said that the article can be very deceiving. What i mean is describing whatever extreme disasters and levels happen in some given parts of a region in any given year.

Yes, a particular region in the South had terrible drought last year. Maybe the worst in a long time (absolutely nobody died and its back to normal). Okay.

But we need to keep in mind it was also one of the best years about 2 provinces over. and then it was average for the other 99% of the country.

Next year 1 region will have 'the most extreme XYZ' and then next year another place the most extreme XYZ. 

I've started studying Chinese history and this is the trend for well over 2000+ years. An endless list of much much more dramatic climate changes, natural disasters and massive cataclysmic droughts, floods and crop failures, hurricanes and lions and tigers and bears are recorded far far back.

China IS doing a lot about Co2 production - they are rapidly and massively modernizing their entire country into 1st world conditions, infrastructure etc. 

They will peak their output by around 2030ish. at which point the modernizing efforts will start to pay off with decreasing levels. The sooner and faster they get there -the better. I recommend sending them all the oil we can ASAP.

Yet more evidence of the general retreat of ice since the end of the LIA is provided by several missions to find the NW Passage. 

That is, in fact, just one. That is one paleoreconstruction of temperatures in July at a site 2000 miles from the north pole with uncertainty estimates higher than the observed variability. One that says things like:

&gt; *""As with other midge-based temperature reconstructions, applications of this temperature transfer function may be hampered by the small range of Holocene variation relative to the statistical uncertainties of the transfer function""* 

and 

&gt;"" *This pattern contrasts with previous high-resolution temperature reconstructions from Alaska... One possible explanation is that our midge-based TJuly estimates for the 20th-century were compromised by lake physical and chemical changes as a result of the railway construction and logging near Moose Lake in the early 1900’s... Ultimately, a network of temperature reconstructions from the region is needed to differentiate climate signals from potential local effects and help explain the discrepancies among these existing temperature records.""*

You see, scientists work hard to understand the limitations of their work, rather than assuming an individual study is inerrant. Moreover paleoclimatologists are well aware of the issues of uncertainty and local variability and would never extrapolate a single record to cover the entire arctic region, but rather would look at a range of records to try to see what the literature says *in aggregate*.

&gt;O'Neill et al. (1994) criticize the IPCC report (Houghton et al., 1990) because it ""offers no rigorous definition of lifetime; for the purpose of defining Global Warming Potentials, it instead presents integrations of impulse-response functions over several finite time intervals. Each of these estimates has its own strengths and weaknesses. Taken together, however, they create confusion over what ""lifetime"" means, how to calculate it, and how it relates to other timescales."" 

and

&gt;Or as O'Neill et al. (1994) phrase it: ""A growing array of timescales are being extracted from carbon cycle models and data and their relationships have not been clear."" . . . ""This discrepancy has not been adequately explained and is causing confusion in the literature concerned with the atmospheric ""lifetime"" of anthropogenic CO2"" . . . ""Considering the policy implications of such numbers, it is important that their meanings and relationships be fully clarified.""

Gosh, that's pretty damning. Let's look deeper at what else O'Neill (1994) *actually* says:

&gt; For the function G(τ) given by eq.(9), this average is 116 years. We may therefore say that according to eq(9), **for any emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere, a fraction equal to ao will effectively remain indefinitely and the rest will stay in the atmosphere an average of 116 years.**

&gt; The IPCC report describes lifetime as equivalent to the adjustment time (Watson et al., 1990); however it cane be shown that even if the carbon cycle is assumed linear, its adjustment time may be 50-90% greater than the epected lifetime of a single emissions added at equilibrium... Since it is an average transit time, this timescale is based on eqs (1d) and (8), except that the response function must be the response of the entire excess CO2 mass to the emissions shut-off, not an impuse response function... Fig. 1 indicates that according to eq. (9), **if emissions ceased in 1990 it would take an average of 175 years (not 116 years) to adjust to the new equilibrium level.**

So the lynch pin criticism your guy quotes is from a paper that concludes that the IPCC estimate of 100 years for the adjustment time (which is not the same as residence time) is *too low*. Funny that he doesn't mention that little fact. ","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2wqkt2",1424794191,2015-02-24 16:09:51,"fishsticks40"

&gt; I see Co2 makes up 0.04% of our atmosphere and I'm told 96% of the Co2 emited is from natural sources while about 4% is man-made (with about 35% of that getting absorbed back down)

This is somewhat misleading; while it is true that most of the fluxes into the atmosphere are natural, under natural conditions those fluxes would be largely matched by the fluxes out of the atmosphere so the overall concentration wouldn't change much (though there have been big changes in the past, but those don't matter for this discussion). If you have a bathtub with the same amount of water going in as going out, the waterlevel will remain the same; if you increase the rate of flow in the waterlevel will rise. So what matters is that we're increasing the flows into the atmosphere above the natural balance they would otherwise have. 

&gt; I had a google and I might have been thinking that its simply that Co2 (from anywhere) makes up just 6% of all greenhouse gasses total.

I suspect this is the same kind of thing - if you include all natural and human-caused GHG including water vapor I could believe that number (though I can't confirm it).

Yeah, it doesn't work that way. That you pick an industrial era date and then whatever 'more Co2' is recorded then that's man-made Co2.  

Oh no, that's now what it means at all. Co2 levels most definitely can rise and fall on their own year to year, decade to decade without any humans existing on Earth or lots of us. 

IF we used that kind of formula then we'd all get VERY confused if a decade from now we see the Co2 ppm drop (which it could do for entirely natural reasons). Nobody would suppose 'therefore humans somehow produced negative-12% Co2.

But yes I understand what you want to say about flux and flow and accumulation but I'm not sure what you'd mean by 'natural balance'?

For the sake of argument we have a decade of increased volcano action (it happens sometimes) and lets say 10% more Volcano Co2 than usual - is that upsetting the natural balance??
I mean.. the atmosphere doesn't somehow know what is 'Earthy Co2' and man-made Co2 and finds the man-made variety is somehow 'interfering' 'throwing the scale off' with some 'natural' stuff on the other side??

Anyways, I guess for just establishing the basics as we know them:

-Good old Nitrogen and Oxygen are 99% of our atmosphere.

- Greenhouse gases make up about 1% of our atmosphere. 

- Water Vapor makes up like 94% of Greenhouse Gases

- Co2 make up about 6% of Greenhouse Gas.

- Man-made Co2 makes up about 4% and Earth 96% emissions.

- Or to put it this way - Co2 makes up about 0.04% of the atmosphere.

(I'll let the classification geeks decide if water vapor is defined as a proper 'gas' heh).

You know the fascinating thing to me is when I've discussed this with just any everyday layperson like my mom or around the lunchroom. People are simply in disbelief and amazement to learn Co2 is just 0.04% of our atmosphere. and then add Earth itself naturally pumps up about 96% of the Co2. Actually they are usually stunned just to find out Co2 is just 6% of greenhouse gases anyways.

The only thing I can think is that they've heard about Co2 so much that in their imaginations its like half our atmosphere and blankets the Earth like a huge invisible cloud.

*also, speaking of my mom - I still cannot convince her that Co2 is a totally natural gas we exhale and is 'good' and plants love - not poisonous C0.  Okay now get this - she has now decided YES - its good for plants but for some reason she she STILL thinks its Carbon MONOxide and last year mentioned that if there is a carbon monoxide leak in her house she feels better knowing she has lots of plants to eat it up.

Well, you're correct up to a point. *Absent other data* it would be wrong to attribute the entirety of the rise to human activities. But the reality is that there's a great deal of other evidence. [Even Anthony Watts agrees that the observed rise in CO2 is human caused.](http://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/08/05/why-the-co2-increase-is-man-made-part-1/)  Humans have released *twice* the amount of CO2 necessary to cause that change if there were no sinks. There is no other source of CO2 that could explain it. This part is really beyond question. 

&gt;But yes I understand what you want to say about flux and flow and accumulation but I'm not sure what you'd mean by 'natural balance'?

&gt; For the sake of argument we have a decade of increased volcano action (it happens sometimes) and lets say 10% more Volcano Co2 than usual - is that upsetting the natural balance?? I mean.. the atmosphere doesn't somehow know what is 'Earthy Co2' and man-made Co2 and finds the man-made variety is somehow 'interfering' 'throwing the scale off' with some 'natural' stuff on the other side??

The problem is that the natural system is pretty much in balance on the time scales we care about (on longer time scales it's a different story). Atmospheric CO2 hasn't been higher than ~300ppm for [650,000 years](http://www.forestcarbonasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Sciencefig41.jpg). Until now. 

As for volcanoes - all volcanic activity releases on the order of 1% of what humans release. So in your example you'd be looking at a relatively short-time forcing (10 years) at a rate 0.001 times what humans produce. 

&gt;Anyways, I guess for just establishing the basics as we know them:

&gt;-Good old Nitrogen and Oxygen are 99% of our atmosphere.

&gt; Greenhouse gases make up about 1% of our atmosphere.

&gt; Water Vapor makes up like 94% of Greenhouse Gases

&gt; Co2 make up about 6% of Greenhouse Gas.

&gt; Man-made Co2 makes up about 4% and Earth 96% emissions.

&gt;Or to put it this way - Co2 makes up about 0.04% of the atmosphere.
(I'll let the classification geeks decide if water vapor is defined as a proper 'gas' heh).

I'm not sure what your point is here - there's not very much CO2? Sure, by certain metrics. The only reason this is relevant is to support the ""argument by incredulity""; i.e. ""it's such a tiny amount, it couldn't possibly matter!"" which is refuted by a VAST amount of scientific data.

Correct me if I'm misinterpreting, but I believe what you're saying is that when looking at CO2 now vs CO2 in pre-industrial times, we can't distinguish between CO2 produced by humans and CO2 produced naturally. Am I understanding that? 

If so, that isn't correct. We actually can very easily determine what CO2 is in the atmosphere as a result of human activity. Carbon in the atmosphere is mostly present in three isotope forms: C12, C13, and C14. Plants also have carbon, and the C12 isotope is present in higher levels in plants than in the atmosphere. Oil and coal are made largely from prehistoric plant matter, and therefore the oil and coal we burn has more C12 than C13. So when we measure atmospheric Carbon, we're seeing more and more C12. The *only* way that happens is through human activity. While CO2 levels can change naturally in the atmosphere, the ratio of C12 to C13 does not, until now. 

&gt;Co2 levels most definitely can rise and fall on their own year to year, decade to decade without any humans existing on Earth or lots of us.

Kind of. Historically, a 100ppm change in CO2 levels took place over 5,000-20,000 years. Humans have managed to raise CO2 levels by 100ppm in just 120 years. That kind of rate is unprecedented, and it's only continuing to rise. We're also doing something that nature never did: eliminating carbon sinks. Carbon sinks, like forests and algae, take in carbon to balance levels in nature. But we're cutting down forests and polluting our waters, essentially killing off our carbon sinks. So not only are we putting out more CO2 than has ever been seen on earth, we're eliminating the systems that would otherwise absorb excess Carbon.

&gt;For the sake of argument we have a decade of increased volcano action (it happens sometimes) and lets say 10% more Volcano Co2 than usual - is that upsetting the natural balance??

Volcanos account for 65 million to 315 million tons of CO2 per year. Humans, however, are emitting 30 **billion** tons per year. If volcanos emitted 10% more than usual, it'd still be a minute fraction of the amount humans are emitting. That should also tell you something dramatic about Climate change though, because huge volcanic eruptions have effected the climate in the past. If that small amount could effect climate, humans certainly can (and are).

&gt;People are simply in disbelief and amazement to learn Co2 is just 0.04% of our atmosphere. and then add Earth itself naturally pumps up about 96% of the Co2. Actually they are usually stunned just to find out Co2 is just 6% of greenhouse gases anyways.

It doesn't seem like much, but even tiny changes can have big effects. But we can see clearly in large scale history how important CO2 levels are, despite their overall concentration. And as /u/fishsticks40 noted, its all about balance. The earth can naturally balance historically normal levels of CO2 that change gradually. When levels increase, carbon sinks slowly store that excess carbon, releasing it much later when levels fall. But we're talking scales of 10,000, 20,000, even 100,000 years here. Humans are now producing huge quantities of carbon on top of the historically norms, and earth simply doesn't have systems to cope with levels above the historical norms, especially because what systems it does have (see carbon sink paragraph above), we're rapidly destroying.

I'm not sure what you mean about ""nature making a distinction."" Nature is not a sentient being, so it doesn't actively make distinctions or ""care"" about different types of CO2. The point is from a human point of view: we can measure atmospheric CO2 levels and, by measuring the C12 and C13 isotopes, directly observe how much carbon came from human emissions. If you're asking why plants have more C12, it's because C12 is a lighter isotope and the photosynthesis process eliminates the heavier C13 isotope from the plant tissue. 

&gt;I have to tell you everything I've come across says we are not losing forests but almost everywhere on earth is expanding its green. (probably due to Co2 increasing) so that is balancing things. Do you know how much?

We're losing approximately 29,000 square miles of forest [every year](http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/deforestation-overview/). What you might have heard is in regard to melting peat bogs in higher latitudes, especially in Europe. This is not a good thing. Peat bogs are massive carbon sinks that keep many millions of tons of Carbon dioxide locked in. When they melt, that CO2 is released into the atmosphere, which only exacerbates the problem.

&gt;I don't know why youre saying were polluting our oceans in some way that is killing it off for C02 balances? Is there some research showing this?

Aquatic plants, like forests, are carbon sinks. Pollution can kill those plants. As a result, we lose yet another mechanism for absorbing Carbon Dioxide.

&gt; No, I don't yet have any reason to believe Earth cannot cope with the speed of Co2 increasing this quickly. Who says that Earth cannot handle that?

97% of scientists say that. Are you one of them? For example, [here](http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/early/2014/04/22/G35434.1.abstract) is a highly acclaimed paper that talks about the historical ability of earth to respond to rapid greenhouse gas increases. (hint if you don't make it to the end: it leads to mass extinctions and general death and destruction everywhere).

Pollution 'can kills those plants' isn't the same as determining we have and are killing off plants with pollution. Do you know if there are any less in our oceans? I did read an article saying there is much more (possibly due to increased Co2).

97% of scientists did not say Earth cannot handle the speed at which C02 is increasing. You need to understand that years ago 97% of scientists agreed 1) Co2 is increasing 2) its a greenhouse gas. 3) its partly responsible for warming. They did not agree that Earth cannot cope with the speed of Co2 increasing and as you can see the only effects so far are a massive 'greening' around the world. So the Earth is coping just fine and we will see if mass extinctions happen and general death occur but so far there isn't a way to know this type of thing past some speculations.

It doesn't. And I'm not saying that it does. The point is that CO2 (made of C12, C13, and C14) levels overall are increasing. We can measure (using C12) how much of that change is a result of human emissions. 

The ""balance"" I think you're referring to is the balance between carbon absorption (via carbon sinks, plants, etc) and carbon emission (from animals, geothermal sources, etc). Humans upset that balance by emitting way more CO2 into the atmosphere than is remotely normal and by eliminating carbon sinks through deforestation and similar destructive practices. 

&gt;It doesn't help any of us to know what forest is LOST every year unless we know how much forest grows upward, outword and is entirely new GAINED forest.

Fair enough. Global deforestation in this decade is roughly 29,000 square miles per year. Expansion is roughly 9,000 per year. That leaves us with a net loss of approximately 20,000 square miles ([5.2 million hectares](http://www.earth-policy.org/indicators/C56/forests_2012)) per year. Not good.

&gt;Pollution 'can kills those plants' isn't the same as determining we have and are killing off plants with pollution. Do you know if there are any less in our oceans?

Yes, we're already seeing an effect in our oceans. And keep in mind that high CO2 levels are themselves pollution, and the effect on oceans is known as ""ocean acidification."" Because of high CO2 levels (combined with other human factors like chemicals, byproducts of industry, and other gas emissions), we've seen a [30% rise](http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-acidification) in ocean acidification. This has lead to significant and observable effects, especially on coral reefs which, in many areas like the Caribbean and Maldives, have been reduced by [up to 90%](http://myweb.facstaff.wwu.edu/~shulld/ESCI%20432/Bellwood2004.pdf).

&gt; I did read an article saying there is much more (possibly due to increased Co2).

Certain algae and phytoplankton do bloom more with increased CO2. But that isn't necessarily a good thing. Many [toxic species](http://www2.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/climate-change-and-harmful-algal-blooms) of algae thrive in warmer waters with more CO2 and that can (and does) lead to detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems.

&gt;97% of scientists did not say Earth cannot handle the speed at which C02 is increasing.

Let me rephrase: 97% of scientists agree that climate change is real and is caused by humans. I don't know the statistics of how many of those scientists agree that climate change is a significant threat, but here's a corollary: The IPCC's latest report makes 4 primary points, one of which is that the net effects of climate change will be strongly negative. Every major scientific organization concurs with the findings of the IPCC and not *one single* scientific organization opposes them. And reading through the many, many studies on climate change, you almost certainly won't find one that both accepts anthropogenic climate change and also claims that it isn't a threat.

&gt;as you can see the only effects so far are a massive 'greening' around the world.

That just isn't at all true. If you can find sources otherwise, please share them. 

&gt;So the Earth is coping just fine

Once again, just not true. But find some sources and share them if that's your argument.

&gt;there isn't a way to know this type of thing past some speculations.

Models and data aren't wild ""speculations."" They're highly refined predictions based on many decades of widespread research and observation. You could say that it was just ""speculation"" that NASA scientists would be able to land an suv-sized rover on a planet 140 million miles using automated systems and a giant rocket crane, but guess what, they nailed it. Do you personally have experience with climate modeling? Or any scientific modeling? If not, you can't begin to understand the complexities and the knowledge that goes into them.

It totally makes sense that Briggs would try to distance himself form Soon's practices and uphold his paper. But that aspect isn't about climate science, so let's move on from that part, and talk about the paper Briggs is referencing.

As much as Briggs wishes it were true, in no way does that paper have anyone in a panic, much less the entire ""left."" (by the way, climate change is not a political issue. It just isn't. It's a scientific issue. There are many republicans who accept climate science). In fact, in the scientific community, this paper is considered pretty laughable, and general consensus is that if a retraction isn't issued it'll be a fairly large surprise.

When Briggs says ""Climate forecasts... stink,"" he's being intellectually dishonest. In the paper, he really only criticizes the models in the IPCC's first assessment report which was published in 1990, and he only looks at the ""business as usual"" scenario from that report, completely ignoring all the other models. 

A couple of things wrong with that:

1. It's true that the models in the FAR weren't necessarily accurate. Why? They weren't general-circulation models, which are far more accurate but hadn't been developed yet. In all the future IPCC reports, general-circulation models were used. There's just really no contest that general-circulation models are far superior to their predecessors. Yet Briggs and co, in this paper, try to use a very simple model that they developed, and they literally say in the paper ""The simple climate model outlined here is not intended as a substitute for the general-circulation models."" In other words, their model (which is incredibly simplistic), isn't general-circulation. So why even bother?

2. Using only the ""business as usual"" scenario from the FAR is misleading (the FAR used several scenarios) because it assumed that population would continue growing at a 1980s rate, cars would have the same gas mileage they did in the late 1980s, coal plants would have the same emissions they did in the 1980s, etc etc. Those things obviously aren't true. Other scenarios accounted for that.

So long story short, bad paper, not even remotely causing panic by anyone.

If there is some 'natural balance' of Co2 then we can't figure out what that is until we know what level Co2 is supposed to be at. 

You mentioned losing forests at 5 million hectares but thats a relatively tiny difference with around 4 billion hectares of forest on Earth and you must have some figures for the greening? The greening isn't necessarily impressive for 'widening' but for simply getting bigger and more Co2 hungry in place. 

Yes, I've read that ocean algae might be increasing (along with the greening effect) which might be because of increased Co2 food so that would be balancing Co2.

Something about that 97% thing. About a decade ago the scientists who put together an agreement on Co2 had 3% of them NOT agree??
Because I don't even know any Climatocaust Deniers who don't agree 1.) Humans emit Co2 and 2) its a Greenhouse Gas and I don't think 3% of ClimateDeniers even disagree on the 'getting warmer' part either. (granted it depends on your start date).

So how in the world did 3% of people in a group taking that position NOT agree with the other 97%??

As for the threat level - yes that is a totally different thing and you have some very serious controversies and failures with the predictions so far:  Almost nobody predicted (or has really explained) why we'd have 15 years of no overall warming. Nobody was predicting sea-level rise would SLOW either. There was a few people who predicted the Earth would be greening every year but the IPCC AGW people did NOT do anything with that. 

I don't know if I need to find any sources on the non-effects of warming (which hasn't really happened for a decade or more) because there isn't anything to get sources on (tho we have sources on global greening). There are less Hurricanes in one given time period in one region and more lesser Storms in another region. Polar bears are fine. Sea Levels are rising at a slightly less rate but either way at zero 'threat' levels to anyone anywhere. 

How would I find 'sources' for the Earth coping just fine, as usual? by trying to list everything that isn't happening vs the same amount of things that happen that always happened?

I strongly agree climate models are vastly complicated with tremendous amount of math and science invested in them but that shouldn't impress you when you consider how complex and how many unknown variables go into weather, climate and the biosphere. 

The ever growing lists of failed climate change predictions is getting longer and longer at dramatically rising rates:
http://wattsupwiththat.com/2014/04/02/the-big-list-of-failed-climate-predictions/

Now, having said all this - there is no chance Co2 emissions will do anything but rise and rise for at least another 60 years and the solution of carbon taxes, increased regulation etc are absolutely not going to happen. So you might want to think of the next best solution IF you think Global warming will be bad.

"2503","cowhwmk","3","0","t1_cowfy9q","I'm considering how best to answer your comments, but a big problem I have with them is that you seem to just be saying things you believe without backing them up in any way. That isn't how science works. If you're going to discuss science, you need to be able to cite studies, data, and empirical evidence to support your claims. If you don't understand the scientific process, I recommend reading up on the basics a little more. 

So I'll try to answer your questions while giving some examples of where you need to support your claims.

&gt;If there is some 'natural balance' of Co2 then we can't figure out what that is until we know what level Co2 is supposed to be at.

What is your basis for this? Why can't we understand balance without knowing a specific level? And which specific level would that be? Talking about CO2 balance requires a knowledge of the carbon cycle. We know that the ideal range for human life is between [180ppm and 400ppm](http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.1126)

&gt;You mentioned losing forests at 5 million hectares but thats a relatively tiny difference with around 4 billion hectares of forest on Earth

It may not seem like much, but consider this: in pre-industrial times there were [5.9 billion](http://www.earth-policy.org/indicators/C56) hectares of forest on earth. We've now cut that down to just over 4 billion. That's a decrease of roughly 33%. Furthermore, one hectare of forest stores between [100 and 650 tons](http://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/how-much-carbon-do-different-forests-store-what-size-offsets-your-driving-for-a-year.html) of carbon (depending on the type of forest). If the average is 300 (that's a low estimate), that's 1.5billion tons of carbon in the atmosphere that would otherwise have been absorbed by the 5 million hectares of forest that were cut down. Every year.

&gt;and you must have some figures for the greening? The greening isn't necessarily impressive for 'widening' but for simply getting bigger and more Co2 hungry in place.

This sentence makes almost no sense. You need to be more clear and support your claims here. 

&gt;which might be because of increased Co2 food so that would be balancing Co2.

Again, you need to support the claim that more algae would be balancing Co2. Some extra algae blooms are not enough to absorb all the carbon that would otherwise be stored in forests, aquatic plants, peat bogs, etc. All the carbon sinks destroyed by humans.

&gt;Something about that 97% thing. About a decade ago the scientists who put together an agreement on Co2 had 3% of them NOT agree?? Because I don't even know any Climatocaust Deniers who don't agree 1.) Humans emit Co2 and 2) its a Greenhouse Gas and I don't think 3% of ClimateDeniers even disagree on the 'getting warmer' part either. (granted it depends on your start date).

This also makes little to no sense. Frankly I can't even tell what you're trying to say here. Scientists didn't put together an agreement on CO2, so I'm not sure what you're referencing, and the term ""Climatocaust"" is beyond absurd. If you're going to talk science, talk science, not hyperbole. 

&gt; So how in the world did 3% of people in a group taking that position NOT agree with the other 97%??

Again, this makes no sense. 97% of scientists agree that climate change is caused by humans. 3% do not. I don't think I can make that any more simple.

&gt;Almost nobody predicted (or has really explained) why we'd have 15 years of no overall warming.

In terms of climate cycles, 15 years is a tiny amount of time, and scientists have always been clear that decadal variations do occur. Looking at the [long term trend](http://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/) shows a huge warming pattern. And 15 of the hottest years on record have occurred in the past 20 years. Normally, records like that would occur once or twice a century. 

&gt;you have some very serious controversies and failures with the predictions so far

Once again, can you provide a source to back this up? It really just isn't true. [This](http://www.skepticalscience.com/graphics/slr_prediction_med.jpg) is a chart showing the IPCC's predictions compared with observed temperatures. As you can see, decidedly within the predicted range.

&gt;There was a few people who predicted the Earth would be greening every year

Support your claim. And clarify what you mean by ""greening."" You use that term a lot, but not correctly.

&gt;I don't know if I need to find any sources on the non-effects of warming (which hasn't really happened for a decade or more) because there isn't anything to get sources on

Again, if you're going to argue science, you do need to find sources. There are over 22,000 papers on climate change out there, surely you can dig one up to support at least one of your claims.

&gt;There are less Hurricanes in one given time period in one region and more lesser Storms in another region. 

This doesn't make any sense either. Climate change is not measured in number of hurricanes in one year. However, an increase in extreme weather events globally is an effect of climate change, and that's [exactly what we're seeing](http://mudancasclimaticas.cptec.inpe.br/~rmclima/pdfs/publicacoes/2006/Tebaldietal2006_CC.pdf).

&gt;Sea Levels are rising at a slightly less rate

[No](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Trends_in_global_average_absolute_sea_level%2C_1870-2008_%28US_EPA%29.png/640px-Trends_in_global_average_absolute_sea_level%2C_1870-2008_%28US_EPA%29.png)

&gt;either way at zero 'threat' levels to anyone anywhere.

[No](http://epa.gov/climatestudents/impacts/signs/sea-level.html) [no](http://www.climatecommunication.org/affects/sea-level-rise/) [no](http://www.oregon.gov/dsl/SSNERR/docs/EFS/EFS39risesea.pdf). A million times no. 

&gt;How would I find 'sources' for the Earth coping just fine, as usual? by trying to list everything that isn't happening vs the same amount of things that happen that always happened?

You would find a paper or study demonstrating how the Earth is dealing with rising CO2 levels, for example a paper on how more CO2 is being taken up by aquatic ecosystems to compensate. No such paper exists that I know of, that's just an example. But the fact that you don't know that papers and studies (aka primary sources) should be your first stop when talking about science clearly demonstrates that you don't understand the scientific process at even the most basic level.

&gt; The ever growing lists of failed climate change predictions is getting longer and longer at dramatically rising rates

Can you provide a scientific source rather than a blog post? 

&gt;Now, having said all this - there is no chance Co2 emissions will do anything but rise and rise for at least another 60 years

That's not at all true. If humans take some basic steps, we can cause CO2 emissions to plateau and eventually drop and we can do it with a net benefit to the global economy.

&gt; the solution of carbon taxes, increased regulation etc are absolutely not going to happen. 

They already are happening. We have increased regulation in the U.S. and there are carbon taxes implemented in many countries around the world.

&gt;So you might want to think of the next best solution IF you think Global warming will be bad.

Let me challenge you to consider what happens if YOU are wrong. Image that 97% of the worlds scientists are right. These are people who have advanced degrees, people who spent years and years at the best universities learning scientific principles that most of us couldn't even begin to understand. People who work with the best monitoring equipment in the world and spend their lives studying this stuff. Image they are right and you, for undoubtedly the first time ever, are wrong. Do you know what happens if that's case? If climate change is real and the effects are negative?

Here's what happens: 

- 500,000 people [will die](http://www.ghf-ge.org/human-impact-report.pdf) from climate change related disasters every year by 2030

- 350,000 more per year will suffer adverse health effects

- [Water demand](http://www.daraint.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/CVM2-Low.pdf) will increase by 80%

- Economic losses will total 340 billion per year

- Global food production will drop by 50 million tons and food costs will rise by 20% in many regions

Those are just a few points and they're conservative estimates. So on the one hand, we can ignore the thousands of scientists who study this shit for a living and deal with all the unpleasantries above. On the other hand we could listen to them, take action, boost the economy in the process, and avoid lots of people dying.

You clearly don't understand the carbon cycle at the most basic level. I'll attempt one more time to explain the ""balance"" principle as simply as I can. Carbon cycle *balance* is achieved when the amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere is matched by the amount of CO2 stored in carbon sinks and the ocean. That *balance* keeps CO2 levels between 180ppm and 400ppm. Do you see the relationship between range and balance? Balance is a *process.* Range is the *result.*

&gt; IF you do have studies showing the increase in Green + Algae then why aren't you factoring those into things? Those would be MAJOR factors. 

Like I clearly stated, Algae blooms are **not** a major factor in CO2 absorption. In fact, they are more harmful than beneficial. [Here](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gustaaf_Hallegraeff/publication/243776284_A_review_of_harmful_algal_blooms_and_their_apparent_global_increase/links/53ea8f2c0cf2dc24b3cddfb0.pdf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;scisig=AAGBfm2V3sZFoHBBLUi9B1BTp0jS4D-UgA&amp;nossl=1&amp;oi=scholarr) is a source. [Here](http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1476-069X-7-S2-S4.pdf) is another.

&gt;I keep getting told underwater volcanoes are a major emiter of Co2

Whoever told you this is simply lying to you. This is why you should look at SOURCES. Not random things you hear on the internet. Underwater volcanos emit [66-97 million tons](http://www.skepticalscience.com/print.php?r=50) of CO2 per year, the majority of which is absorbed by the lava they form. They have even less impact than land volcanos. And again, humans emit 30 billion per year.

&gt;I do NOT have to 'imagine' that 97% of the worlds scientists are right because I already have an IPCC (which is not all the scientists in the world or even all climate researchers) but like everyone but their 3% I am well convinced 1) Humans emit Co2 2) Co2 is a greenhouse gas.

This simply doesn't make sense. I have no idea what you're trying to convey here.

&gt; None of those scientists study the 340 billion in losses or the reduction of food production by 50 million tons or rises in food costs or 80% increases in water demands because none of those things have happened.

Except some of them do study that... We've already seen a measurable increase in economic loss due to natural disasters and climate change and an estimated 300,000 people die a year due to climate change issues. (refer to the original source I posted which you very clearly didn't read).

&gt;Citation and source and backup data is as follows: None of those things have happened.

Do you not understand models and predictions? They look at the future.

&gt;But meanwhile it means absolutely nothing to you to keep firing alarm bells. Nothing. You are literally producing Co2 for absolutely no reason if all you do is warn and warn and fire off alarms because Co2 is only going to increase.

Again, this makes absolutely no sense. I should talk about the climate change warnings because I'm emitting CO2 when I'm doing it? Utterly absurd.

&gt;So, IF you really believe these things will happen then I would like to see the data on your preparations? Because, IF you believe these predictions I have to believe you will be protecting your own life and those of your children by storing food, water, investing your money accordingly yes?

What I'm doing:

- As of now, I don't intend to have children unless I believe they will live in a significantly better world, one where they don't risk dying from an increase in natural disasters. There aren't really signs to indicate that currently, since our citizens and government lack the will to understand the science. (see every one of your comments for an example).

- I live in a state that has seen increasing wildfires and floods due to climate change. It's observable, tangible, I see things changing around me. The increase in temperatures has brought pine beetle infestations which kill huge swaths of forest, turning the green mountains where I grew up into dead, grey stands. These catch fire and we see large scale wildfires that have, on several occasions, threatened my home. I've invested a *lot* of money to fireproof my home, invested more when unprecedented flooding ruined parts of it, and I will continue to do so as it happens more. I also won't be moving to a coastal area like I once hoped to.

- I work in the climate industry, specifically building tools for investors to make more climate-conscious decisions because I believe this is a valuable way to combat the issue. 

- I drive a hybrid, but bike most of the time.

So yes, I literally live my life in preparation for a changing climate. I've sacrificed a lot to do so because it is real and it is happening. There is no *belief,* it's just real. Scientists are in agreement. The signs are clear. It's already happening and it's observable, and I spend my life trying to fight it so that maybe, just maybe, I can save the life of some idiot on Reddit who never believed me from the start.

&gt;You're the one desperately trying to find an AGW connection in a speech, a speech mind you, from 1965. A speech, if you need to hear this again, that did not mention climate.

There is no other explanation for mentioning CO2, and contrary to your earlier claim, LBJ and his staff *were* aware of CO2's impact on this.

You can argue all you want, you'll grow tired before I do. I have enough energy to do this for years. Do you?

&gt;archie, the fact is that you react to anyone who questions a pro-AW post without thinking

That's not a fact. That's a lie.

&gt;In this thread you even needed another user to supply the argument for you. 

No, they supplied additional *evidence*, but there was already evidence in the sense that *there was no other reason to mention CO2*. If you disagree, mention some of them.

No, I did have a clue. You still don't apparently.

You see, for at least 800,000 years now CO2 has remained below 300ppm. In fact, it's likely to be as much as 2.6 million years, and maybe even more.

For the past 160 years, the concentration has gone up by 40% to around 400ppm. We know from isotopic analyais (and simply by evaluating all of the natural sources and sinks) that this increase is due to human activity, mainly the burning of fossil fuels.

Nothing in Noerdinger's article contradicts what you say here. Please show a foundational claim that he makes in making his argument that you believe is false. I don't believe that you understand the math. I'll point you to eqns 1-5 in the paper, it's the simpler argument (though in eqns 8-10 he makes the argument from conservation of mass and gets an identical result, as one would expect).

&gt;No one else has replicated that experiment. 

That's irrelevant. Lots of experiments don't get replicated, often because there's no reason to replicate it. You're not going to get published for repeating work that's already been done without adding anything new. If someone had tried *and failed* to replicate his experiment and could show him to be wrong, that would be publishable. 

&gt; You seem to believe that you're scientifically apt yet you place the same faith in this single claim as a that of a lone UFO watcher claiming to have seen a saucer. What you're arguing here is utterly ridiculous and you're desperately trying to save face. You've managed to prove my top comment correct with this show of ignorance of elementary school science and absolute faith in whatever appears in a journal. 

I've shown your elementary school science to be wrong with science of roughly the middle-school level. It's really, really, simple stuff, and if it were wrong you should be able to point out his error easily. But you haven't yet even referenced his math, nor shown any sense that you understand his argument. You just don't like it because you don't like his answer.

&gt;You guys have a religious-like faith in the infallibility of your AGW-based beliefs.

This paper isn't AGW-based. Proving it false wouldn't say anything about the truth of AGW, nor would proving AGW false say anything about the truth of this paper. 

&gt;You asked for ""just one"" and that's what you got. Now you're not happy.

What I said: ""*Please provide citations for stomatal and anthropological data that show that the north pole [was ice free]*"". Note the use of the plural for ""citiations"" and the use of the phrase ""north pole"". I also think it's interesting that you refer to stomatal data to show it's been warm at the north pole, since stomata are used as a paleo proxy for CO2 levels, not temperature. Unless you're saying there's a relationship between CO2 and temperature? 

&gt;I don't know from where you're quoting ""As with other midge-based temperature reconstructions..."" or your other ""This pattern contrasts..."".

That's because I read the *actual paper referenced in your link*, rather than the reinterpretation of that paper by professional deniers. Because every time I see a denier quote from a scientific journal I go and check the original source, and every time thus far it's been badly misrepresented. This is no different. 

&gt; You're the one who claimed that there has been consistant ice cover for 125K years. That's a steady state. Are you even following this thread?

That's not a useful definition of a steady state. The climate can vary, and has varied, without melting the polar ice cap. 

So here's your challenge:

1) demonstrate that you've read Noerdinger's paper.

2) demonstrate that you understand his calculations and reasoning, particularly equations 1-5. Again, this is really simple middle school physics, so it should be no problem. 

3) show that one of the assumptions in that reasoning is false. Perhaps you can disprove Archimedes' principle. And then you'll be famous on the denier blogs as the guy who proved AGW to be false!

We care about 160 years ago because that's when CO2 emissions started to go up. Industrial revolution, and all that.

&gt;Okay so what happened was that you were given this thing where we pick some some average (which isn't helpful btw)

What average? I'm looking at the upper limit of CO2 as a starting point, which is quite reasonable.

&gt;and then we choose 1940 as our start date. 

Why choose 1940? You're basically ignoring all of the anthropogenic CO2 produced before that date.

&gt;BS of course because 1) the C02 levels aren't magically at 300ppm right to 1940 and further more you have no way of knowing how much of the increase was natural.

Again, not sure why you picked 1940, but you are wrong in that we *do* have ways of knowing how much of the increase was natural. Multiple ways, in fact (see below).

&gt;I repeat - you have no way of knowing what % of the increase was just happenstance natural Earth made increases 

Sure we do: isotopic analysis of the CO2 is one way, accounting for man-made sources is another. Combine the two and you have a pretty good idea.

Also, there is the fact that CO2 has not gone above 300ppm naturally for millions of years. All of these support the idea that the rise in CO2 is man-made, and that it represents about 40% more than the pre-industrial levels.

&gt;So that is all you need to know to stop being some random internet stranger just spouting off AS IF you are the 'teacher' to me or anyone else with you snippity little white liberal condescending attitude.

Whoa, this has nothing to do with politics. The claims I am making are non-controversial. CO2 levels were under 300ppm for millions of years, and they jumped from ~280-290 to 400ppm in just 160 years, all while humans were putting gigatons of CO2 from fossil fuels in the atmosphere. Even most climate ""skeptics"" don't disagree with this.

From the abstract (not bothering to read the whole thing): 

&gt;The analysis of long-term tide gauge records identified an extreme sea-level rise (SLR) event during 2009–10. Within this 2-year period, the coastal sea level north of New York City jumped by 128 mm. This magnitude of interannual SLR is unprecedented (a 1-in-850 year event) during the entire history of the tide gauge records. Here we show that this extreme SLR event is a combined effect of two factors: an observed 30% downturn of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation during 2009–10, and a significant negative North Atlantic Oscillation index.

They've been making it very clear that sure one region already very hot might get hotter however other colder regions may actually get colder! In another place with droughts might now start suffering from floods! Another region that's never had any hurricanes will start getting them and bigger and faster.  

Now, to get back a little to the original complaint - the AGW salesman here was simply taking the number of people a year that die in I suppose 'warming related' events and attributing all of that to the increased global warming of a given year. Well no. Then (and you mention this) at best you choose the '2% more than usual' figures.

And of course the other problem is not even mentioning that fewer and fewer people die from weather today than ever before and that number continues to decline. 

Especially in China. Where for example they just had the 'worst drought in 100 years' in our a region. Which doesn't mention every year for 100 years SOME regions gets the 'worst something in 100 years'. It was brutally hot and I well promise I suffered but I didn't die and neither did Nai Nai because fans, refridgerators, AC and bottle water are now so inexpensive even villagers can have them.

&gt; suggested WTP/ATP was involved in corruption and money laundering. They found that it solicited unlimited contributions to support candidates and then passed them through a “sham organization,” the Bozeman-based political action committee The Coalition for Energy and the Environment that ran attack ads against Democrats. WTP told corporations that it aimed to combat 'radical environmentalists' and 'beat them at their own game' and that their contributions would remain secret.” [1]
&gt; 
&gt; According to a 2010 filing with the IRS (PDF), ATI received $40,000 from its sister group ATP, which in turn is supported by oil, gas and coal interests.
&gt; 
&gt; It received another $5,000 from the Atlas Economic Research Foundation, a Virginia-based think tank that, according to ExxonSecrets, received over $1 million in funding from Exxon Mobil since 1998. Atlas also received $122,300 from the Koch foundations and $735,000 from the Pope foundation. [8]

Despite the claims of a ""lawsuit"" [ATI's own archived website suggests this was little more than a FOIA request](http://web.archive.org/web/20121005173501/http://www.atinstitute.org/ati-environmental-law-center-seeks-nasa-records-on-dr-james-hansen/) of which there's suspiciously little follow-up.

You can view [the FOIA request itself](http://www.atinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ATI-NASA-Hansen-FOIA-Complaint-June-21-2011.pdf).  It [appears to have been a fishing-expedition in vain -- coming up dry](http://www.atinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ATI_NASA_Hansen_Ethics_Appeal_3-15-11a.pdf):

It seems that [the documents ATI requested _were_ substantially disclosed](http://www.nasaclearlakelitigationblog.com/2012/07/nasa-global-warming-and-freedom-of.html).  Though again, the lack of any follow-up from ATI itself suggests little material support for its claims.

&gt;In 1965 it was considered a pollutant because it was a result of burning.

Sorry, but that's bullshit. Water vapor is a result of burning diesel, is it considered a pollutant?

You're just making stuff up, now.

&gt;Thank you for once again proving my point.

I didn't.

&gt;You want me to change my opinion, or at least let it look like I have.

It would be better if you admitted that you were wrong, but honestly I don't really care about that. I think you should stop responding because there is nothing to gain for you by continuing.

&gt;out of sheer spite.

Again, I'm not sure you know what spite is. You are the one continuing to respond, lying to my face and insulting me, out of sheer spite.

&gt;Scared eh archie?

Why would I be? What rules of reddit did I break?

You must be as bad at poker as you are at chess, because you couldn't bluff if your life depended on it.

&gt;You've been trolling me 

I haven't. I indicated how you were wrong, and you basically lost it.

&gt;You're the one arging for the sake of arguing. That's trolling archie.

No, it isn't. Go look up what the definition of trolling is, you'll look less like a fool next time you go cry to the mods for no good reason.

&gt;...speaking of lies.

Not a lie. Just the truth, which you seem hell-bent on denying.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2vsmmw",1425044958,2015-02-27 13:49:18,"archiesteel"
"2631","coywkrs","1","0","t1_coyuqlf","&gt;I didn't write that in the same way that you've never written what is clearly in your history.

I *never* claimed not to have written something that is in my history. I dare you to provide a link to the actual comments where I said this (not imgur screenshots).

You are such a liar, but at least it's common knowledge, so the damage you can do is very limited.

&gt;Get's frustrating when a person tells such obvious lies and then denies it, isn't it archie?

So you admit you lied, then? Because I didn't, but you clearly did, and you just admitted it.

&gt; And now, when it's thrown back in your face you get pissed.

You didn't ""throw back"" anything to me, because I didn't lie and you are completely unable to find any proof that I have (and no, that imgur link doesn't show that I lied - that is another one of your lies).

&gt;Which is something I've said to you many times. 

Something you've *lied* about many times, you mean.

&gt;And every time you've tried to talk your way out of it.

Every time I've indicated that what you claimed was not true, and not a single person came to your defense. You lost, and you keep losing.

&gt;Every time you get deeper and deeper into shit while blaming other people for your condition.

Actually, that's not me, that's you. You dig yourself into a hole then blame others for it.

&gt; Right now you're getting back what you've spreading for years, and whining about it.

I'm not getting *anything* back. This thread makes you look like a liar, and someone who's not...how can I say this...completely grounded.

&gt;By inventing a whole new aspect of physics.

I didn't invent anything, it's all with the greenhouse effect. I've explained to you many times, but you seem impervious to science.

&gt;It is archie. Once a thread deteriorates to this level you rant.

That's not what you should be ashamed of...did you once again forget what we were talking about? Are you having memory problems, or you're just lying?

&gt;another way of saying that I'm not willing to ""reasonably"" capitulate to you.

No, what I'm saying is that you are not debating in a rational manner, and you are lying to my face. I don't care that you ""capitulate"" or not, and even offered you to agree to disagree (which disproves your claims).

&gt;f you don't enjoy this, why did you troll me in the first place?

I didn't troll you in the first place.

No, it goes to show you are not able to understand scientific articles.

&gt;I do that all the time archie.

Actually, you don't. You never provide solid evidence to back up your claims. Sorry.

&gt;I could, but it's more fun to drive you nuts every morning. 

You don't drive me nuts. Clearly *I* drive you nuts, but I don't enjoy it.

Thanks for admitting you are trolling through (yeah, that's what you did). Perhaps I should do the same as you do, and go whine to the mod?

&gt;That's what you're looking for too isn't it archie?

No.

&gt;Then why did you troll me in the first place?

I didn't. Responding to you isn't trolling. You'll have to grow up a little if you want to be a responsible redditor.

&gt;Yes, it's pointless isn't it? 

Then why do you do it?

&gt;So why did you troll me in the first place?

I didn't, but you admitted above that you are not interested in having a rational debate. Why should I not report you for that?

In the paper, he really only criticizes the models in the IPCC's first assessment report which was published in 1990, and he only looks at the ""business as usual"" scenario from that report, completely ignoring all the other models.

I think he is right to ignore the other models. They all base their premises off of the East Anglia University AGW models which, when the climate-gate emails were shown to the world, conveniently dissappear.  Also the fact that the faked hockeystick models being falsely ""adjusted"" by NOAA  once again support a false premise of global warming? Why? money.  Everyone wants it and the way to get it from everyone is if you regulate the very act of exhailing as  polution, you can tax and regulate life itself. 

To leave you with a little tidbit. NASA said last year was the hottest on record. When pinned they said 38% likelyhood that it was the hottest and by 2/100's of a degree.

I don't know what overwhelming majority you are talking about. The number of people that are educated and experienced enough to make these claims or anti-claims are a small number of the scientific population. Other scientists agree or disagree. This is called consensus science, or in some cases junk science. 

Out of the population that is able to make these claims or anti claims, there is no overwhelming majority and most of these folks base THEIR agreementor disagreement ( and a good number do disagree ) on prehaps 10% that have done the work in modelling. Most notably EAU was responsible for most of the hoaxers modelling. While Soon and Goddard have found issues with the modelling and found the "" adjustments"" Now that the warming hockey stick projections are not coming true, the ""adjustments"" or scientific fraud as most call it, HAVE to be done to the data models to MAKE them fit with the predictions. 


&gt; Moreover it is also so very strange that some people will also dismiss their own common sense and observations that things are seriously changing all around them. Right now there is a critical shortage of water in California due a severe drought.

Here is where you prove my point. you don't know why there is a drought, you just believe it's global warming. The drought is actually caused by the Libreal DEMOCRATS  shutting down inland water to central california, killing farms, lands and propertys, because of a fucking endangered fish.  This is why a large number of the scientific community will call you an idiot for ascribing drought to warming. In this case it was a foolish decision by a judge to side with foolish environmentalists which are ironically destroying the environment.  

http://newsbusters.org/blogs/brad-wilmouth/2009/05/09/fnc-drought-stricken-farmers-lose-fight-water-endangered-fish 

&gt; They also continue to insist that the northern polar ice cap's melting is no big deal though that has never happened in several hundred thousand years and has been so rapid that it is not a natural process because it instead of melting over hundreds and thousands of years, it is happening in only 30 years which has never... Not sometimes but NEVER has happened like that before.

Uh we had an ice age a couple hundred thousand years ago, before that the earth was much warmer than it is now.  Dinosaurs and their SUV's must have been the cause. 

Southern ICE caps are hitting record highs. While one cap may or may not be shrinking another is certainly growing.  NASA addresses this, I believe wrongheadedly because NASA is completely discounting the changing course of the jetstream which has moved the polar air further south, which I believe has caused most warmer air to move north and as such condensing the moisture into land / sea ice.  This to me certainly accounts for the Antarctic ice as well as the polar ice and the thickening across the board.   I don't think the weather is warming at all. I think in some respects it s balancing. 

In my town last winter it was colder on my front lawn than it was at the equator on Mars. Temperature was about -24 degrees ten feet from my front door. THe year before -2 and a shorter stretch of lower temperatures. 

Now if you believe in global warming and if you believe man is responsible for it You are in for a shock.  Some evidence, if you accept it says that Martian temperatures were warming simultaneously with earth, which means the SUN, the big fireball in the sky and the generator of our climate, has warmed the inner solar system. 


http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/02/070228-mars-warming.html

The only reason, again, that scientists and government types say warming is man made, is because man has money and they want it.  Now run along to your global warming church youthgroup or you'll miss out on the brainwashing exercises. :)

 The original 'hockey stick' is a chart showing the world's average temperature year by year for over a century. I would guess that you must believe that there was a conspiracy to promote the idea of global warming long before anyone knew about global warming or had even been born yet. A pre-natal conspiracy and certainly one deserving all of your attention in bringing it to light. Thank you for your tireless efforts in this regard.

 Look at the chart yourself if you aren't an outright phony or simply a fool. Look for yourself!!! 

Drought in California? Yeah and real bad too. One of the worst ever, they think. Very low deposits of snowpack which provide most of California's water. No snow = no water. 90% of federal water allocations to agriculture were stopped last year. Even so the rivers and streams were so low that large numbers of fish die offs occurred. That means losses in tourism and fishing. You remember fishing In California? Multi BILLION dollar salmon fisheries have either collapsed totally or nearly so. Billions $$$ lost. By the by, the sec of the energy has said that in 15 years that California may not be able to grow food. Odd that huh? Does your common sense still see that as normal too? No snow pack = no water. Fish or otherwise.



We did have an Ice Age but it was 12,000 years ago not hundreds of thousands but let's not quibble about minor details! In any case a 120,000 years ago the Ice Cap did melt although very slowly and took a couple of thousand years to do it unlike now when we are doing it in 30 years. 30 years &lt;&lt;&lt; see that number? 30 ... not thousands of years of gradual melt but melting away in 30 years! And your common sense says what about that? 

Oh and by the by... some 375 cubic kilometers of ice melt off Greenland each year these days and the rate of melting is speeding up too. Have your common sense picture an ice cube that is 233 miles high...233 miles wide and 233 miles long. Kind of big huh? Oh and by the by...um...and by... 125 kilometers of ice melts off Antarctica each year and that is increasing too. Yes the ice is increasing in the west but not enough to balance out how much ice is melting in the east. Also the surface ice around Antarctica is newly formed ice and not the much thicker sheets of old ice which were much harder to melt in their summer. New thin ice melts faster which is worrisome for the future. There is less ice in Antarctica each year and that is the actual fact. NO the Antarctic ice cap is NOT increasing but instead it is steadily decreasing. Scientists had thought even only five or ten years ago that Antarctica would not start to melt for a thousand years yet... they were wrong.It took ten years to start.

You rant about how cold it is in winter where you are...lol. Winter does do! It is not all that surprising that it gets cold in winter. Although they said last year was the year without snow over ALL of North America which was a first and I bet you walked around without needing to bundle up like you do this year. People have NEVER said that the world will uniformly get warm like raising the thermostat in your house. They HAVE said that global warming will make the weather unpredictable from year to year. Goodbye to the farmer's almanac ability to predict the coming year's weather based on the usual weather of older years. This is not your father's weather!!! 

Katrina happened one year, Sandy happened another, those three (one after the other) super typhoons (biggest ever) that hit the Phiipines followed... no you can't predict your local weather but worldwide the increase in ocean temperatures is generating more energy in the atmosphere which creates bigger and more powerful storms SOMEWHERE but not in the same places every year. 

So-o-o yes you are experiencing cold weather in winter. It does that you know! It gets cold in winter...someone should have told you about that. Nevertheless the permafrost is melting in Alaska and Siberia and corals are bleaching in the Caribbean and rising sea levels threaten Venice and Sandy brought flood surges over fifteen feet high in New York city streets and flooded the subways (yeah that's normal...um...okay yeah) and ... well I could go on refuting your uninformed assertions... but MY common sense tells me that you really don't want to know what is true or not... you just want to believe what you want to believe whether it's the truth or not! 

So good bye and ""How's the weather!"" No need to keep repeating your ridiculous ranting and as always there is no need to show any common sense of your own, you are a republican after all and that would be a lot to ask. 

 
P.S. You know it is really quite amusing (if somewhat pathetic) that whenever winter rolls around that all the conservatives jump up and say &gt;&gt;&gt; 'See it's cold out! Where is global warming?"" Yes, it gets cold in winter... that never used to be a surprise like they seem to think it is. Somebody should tell them.

Nobody ever said otherwise. What I said was that cars would have the same gas mileage they did in the 1980's and coal plants would have the same emissions. The models absolutely account for more cars and coal plants based on population growth, but the ""business as usual"" scenario assumes that those cars and coal plants would have the same Carbon output they did in the 80s. In reality, cars and coal plants have become more efficient.

I'm not sure why you think that you've been my source, but let's have a quick review, shall we, of just a few of the many wild, bizarre, and totally unsubstantiated claims you've made without providing any citation or source whatsoever. This'll be fun, here we go:

&gt;everything I've come across says we are not losing forests but almost everywhere on earth is expanding its green. (probably due to Co2 increasing) so that is balancing things.

No source.

&gt;the only effects so far are a massive 'greening' around the world.

No source.

&gt; So the Earth is coping just fine

No source.

&gt; If there is some 'natural balance' of Co2 then we can't figure out what that is until we know what level Co2 is supposed to be at.

No source and also doesn't make sense.

&gt; The greening isn't necessarily impressive for 'widening' but for simply getting bigger and more Co2 hungry in place.

No source.

&gt;Yes, I've read that ocean algae might be increasing (along with the greening effect) which might be because of increased Co2 food so that would be balancing Co2.

No source.

&gt;you have some very serious controversies and failures with the predictions so far

No source.

&gt;Almost nobody predicted (or has really explained) why we'd have 15 years of no overall warming.

No source.

&gt;There are less Hurricanes in one given time period in one region and more lesser Storms in another region.

No source.

&gt;Polar bears are fine. Sea Levels are rising at a slightly less rate but either way at zero 'threat' levels to anyone anywhere.

No source.

&gt;there is no chance Co2 emissions will do anything but rise and rise for at least another 60 years and the solution of carbon taxes, increased regulation etc are absolutely not going to happen.

No source.

&gt;IF you do have studies showing the increase in Green + Algae then why aren't you factoring those into things? Those would be MAJOR factors.

No source.

&gt;I keep getting told underwater volcanoes are a major emiter of Co2

No source.

&gt;None of those scientists study the 340 billion in losses or the reduction of food production by 50 million tons or rises in food costs or 80% increases in water demands because none of those things have happened.

No source.

&gt;Co2 is only going to increase.

No source.

&gt;Nobody has died from AGW climate change issues.

No source.

&gt;MANY people die every year from climate change but many LESS are dying every year.

No source.

&gt;we haven't lost any money on 'AGW Climate Change' since we spend the same amounts every year on regular climate change - something which is not as dangerous today as 100 years ago.

No source and also doesn't make sense.

&gt;I certainly do understand models and predictions and a great many from a decade ago did NOT OCCUR.

Do you have a scientific source to support that, or do you just ""think"" that?  Llike /u/archiesteel mentioned, models work on large timescales, not small ones. So if inaccuracies are observable in a model from 2010, it's probably just because the model is only 5 years old, not long enough to observe the accuracy against the long term trend.

That being said, models have proven to be very accurate. If anything, they tend to be too conservative. For example, [here's an IPCC model](http://www.skepticalscience.com/images/SLR_models_obs.gif) from the 90s. As you can see, not inaccurate, just conservative. 

Also, scientists have taken advantage of extreme geological events to test models. For example, after the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, scientists tested models with data from the eruption (i.e. emissions into the atmosphere), and the results were very accurate.

Wait. I don't know what you think you are saying here but let's clarify:

Only a very small % of our world's scientists are in fields that relate to Climate. I think most of the consensus reports we get are made up of less than 2000 scientists who have any meaningful authority on this. (not all are pure climatologists but in related fields). 

Now let's go with 2000 and I cannot tell you why 3% of them are Climate-Deniers but speaking to the 97% of the 2000 they are just agreeing on:

1. Humans emit Co2  2. Co2 is a greenhouse gas. 

3. This starts getting wide and broad. Humans are 'contributing' to warming. this can mean everything from agreeing its an tiny and insignificant degree to a major 'driving factor' to whatever else. 

So that's not very many people.

If someone is telling you a poll was taken of the other 2 million scientists working around the world and '97% of them agreed' its great but asking a biologist or computer science major or a immunologist if they 'agree' is as good as asking a Financial Investor or a Bridge Engineer or a Venture Capitalist.

That's a sort of 'meaningless' thing in this. (and I cannot imagine anything near the whole world's scientists have ever even been asked about this lol).

Uh, yes it is when your only reason for doing so is to upset the thread. There is only one reason to leave a reply that insists that a comment is wrong - you want to start a spat. That's trolling.

&gt;Actually, it was false, as me and others demonstrated.

&gt;No other reasons to mention CO2, /u/oortcloud.

Yes, there was.

&gt;Sorry, but that's bullshit. Water vapor is a result of burning diesel, is it considered a pollutant?

No archie, that's accurate. CO2 was considered a pollutant. Are you really so ignorant that you think only deisel produces water?

&gt;It would be better if you admitted that you were wrong, but honestly I don't really care about that. I think you should stop responding because there is nothing to gain for you by continuing.

You wrote much the same ealier. Frustration makes people miss stuff like that.

&gt;You are such a liar, but at least it's common knowledge, so the damage you can do is very limited.

I'm well known for truthfullness. You on the other hand...

&gt;So you admit you lied, then? Because I didn't, but you clearly did, and you just admitted it.

&gt;You didn't ""throw back"" anything to me, because I didn't lie and you are completely unable to find any proof that I have (and no, that imgur link doesn't show that I lied - that is another one of your lies).

&gt;Something you've lied about many times, you mean.

When such behavior is thrown back in your face you don't know how to handle it. archie, you're a walking parody of yourself. (and the screenshots must be getting to you)

&gt;Every time I've indicated that what you claimed was not true, and not a single person came to your defense. You lost, and you keep losing.

Why would I need someone to defend me? I've done very well against two people whose only ""argument"" has been ""That's what he *must* have meant"". No archie, what I said at the top is correct and your objection is mere speculation. The number of comments indicates that few were interested in the article in the first place. 

&gt;Actually, that's not me, that's you. You dig yourself into a hole then blame others for it.

That's childish projection again archie. I can defend everything I've said. All I blame you for is being a pest for no reason. And we have this as proof: http://imgur.com/5JQRwHI

&gt;I'm not getting anything back. This thread makes you look like a liar, and someone who's not...how can I say this...completely grounded.

Everything I've done in this thread, since your initial objection, has been by design. i've turned your trolling and lying back on you. This can stop any time archie - you just need to disappear. If you don't, then this continues.

&gt; I didn't invent anything...

You invented an earth that glows in IR: http://imgur.com/a/j1mLL/all

Just another occasion where you've used the ""typing monkey"" approach to AGW ""science"".

&gt;That's not what you should be ashamed of...did you once again forget what we were talking about? Are you having memory problems, or you're just lying?

More ranting. 

&gt;No, what I'm saying is that you are not debating in a rational manner, and you are lying to my face. I don't care that you ""capitulate"" or not, and even offered you to agree to disagree (which disproves your claims).

The ""debate"" ended a long time ago archie. I refused to capitulate and so this goes on: http://imgur.com/5JQRwHI

&gt;I didn't troll you in the first place.
&gt;Well, since I didn't troll you, this doesn't apply.

You think finding an excuse not to deal with the points made and then trotting out some irrelevant details is wriggling out from the accusation that you do not want to know the actual facts? It is typical of GW deniers to never actually try to find out what is the truth because they truly don't want to know what is the truth. 

The chart of the world's average temperatures IS the original hockey stick. Look at it yourself and decide or face the fact that you are a liar about judging the facts. What is worse though is that I think that you probably do have a pretty good idea of what you'd see and you are trying to avoid seeing it! I think you know what you'll find out and THAT is why you never look at any of the facts yourself because you honestly don't want to know. Plain and simple... you simply refuse to find out if you are right or wrong. 

The melting Ice Cap? Do you really want to run away from trying to disprove that tiny little piece of data? You know that there is nothing that you can say that wouldn't sound foolish. A melting ice cap is a pretty big deal. A bit of nostalgia &gt;&gt;&gt; when it was first suggested that the north polar ice cap was melting that your conservative side shouted and insulted and sneered that it would never happen and that some hippie tree hugger types scientists were way off base! Remember that back then? Remember when you guys sounded exactly like the way you guys sound now? In fact it was in response to the scientific reports that were beginning to warn about a melting ice cap that some damn fool started to claim that they were wrong and that we were heading for a new ice age. The scientists that wasn't true but you guys didn't care to check the reports yourselves and tried to run with it. Never went anywhere but guess what ...you guys now try to suggest that back then everybody believed there would be a new ice age (because your guys were trying your usual shenanigans). 

Try and find some serious scientific report or even one scientist (and i don't mean a UFO aliens causing an ice age crap) that said we were heading for an ice age. I looked. I was curious because back then nobody was saying that except fringe kooks. Were those guys friends of yours?

World temperatures for the past century... hard to fake that too... huh!

 The last time the north polar ice cap melted was over 120,000 years ago and it took several thousand years to melt. We are melting ours in 30 years. 


Waiting in suspense for your fact based answers... if you think you've got them!


P.S. During the previous mini-warming periods like the much cited medieval warm period... the ice cap never melted. Nor did it during any of the others. 

Look at your nonsense. I point out that the last time the ice cap melted was over a 120,000 years ago and you say that in the last 100,000 years there have only been 10,000 years of warm period. Do you realize which side you are supposed to be on because you seem a bit hysterical or confused and making points for my side right there. The last Ice Age ended about 11,000 years ago and we aren't due for the next one for another 20 or 30,000 years at a minimum. So what or which was your point? Medieval Interglacial (warming) or the Medieval Glacial (cooling) or maybe you do mean both (?) because either one or both of them together are IRRELEVANT!!! 

Scientists (You remember them? The people who spend their professional lives studying various aspects reality) say that El Nino/El Nina conditions in the pacific are changing and that we have been in one of those mini-cooling period for years but that it is due to stop soon. That means that when this mini-cooling period it stops that our climate will get warmer! And rapidly too. Just a point. Did you know that the man made warming that we have been experiencing is due to get even warmer when this natural cycle (at present the dial is set to the cool cycle) goes back to normal (when the dial will be set to warming again)? I mean you people constantly talk natural cycles and stuff so I figure that I'd point out a fact about climate cycles that for some strange inexplicable reason... you folks always forget to mention.

It would be hotter right now because we are in one of those mini-cooling periods but the cool period is due to stop in a few years and the it will be noticeably hotter still.

And now I'm realy going to mail you for poor research: Skip down to find a more recent reference in Gwyther et all 2012, and we find that Noerdinger is indeed listed in the references, but that reference is in this sentance - **""Since ice shelves are already floating, any change to their mass causes negligible sea level rise contribution [6].""** Once again, no impact at all on the Gwyther paper. 

As I said, you're trying to sell garbage here for some reason in some attempt to prove that believers are as wise as skeptics. It's not working out for you.

Yes. it's an AGW-related paper. It says so right at the top of the abstract.

I never said that. I said that they used the 107 stations in the READER dataset. Every dataset contains at least 10 years of data and is currently in operation, or contains at least 25 years of data if it has been discontinued. 

Do you actually think the authors are lying? 

&gt;We use near-surface air temperature data from 42 occupied stations and 65 AWSs from the READER (Reference Antarctic Data for Environmental Research) data set. We use passive infrared brightness measurements (TIR) of surface temperature from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer8, a satellite of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. We use the RegEM algorithm to combine the data from occupied weather stations with the TIR and AWS data in separate reconstructions of the near-surface Antarctic temperature field. Split calibration/verification tests are performed by withholding pre- and post-1995 TIR and AWS data in separate RegEM calculations. Calibration and verification statistics are calculated for each grid point from the comparison of the reconstructed time series and the original temperature time series.

I don't think that is correct, as the [PDO looks like it is bottoming out](http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/jisao-pdo/mean:60). Furthermore, it isn't just the PDO that caused the raise in surface temperatures to slow down, but rather a combination of factors and natural cycles, including the PDO, the AMO, the ENSO cycle, the solar cycle, etc.. This alignment explains why this slowdown was longer than others that happened before it, but the conditions that allow it to exist won't last for much longer.

Well, this is why Climate Sensitivity is determined for a *doubling* of CO2, and not a fixed amount.

That said, considering the speed at which new CO2 is added, and that there is still a lot of warming ""in the pipeline"", we should expect the resumed warmng to be as fast and maybe faster than the one before the so-called slowdown (at least this is what the new Mann paper is arguing).","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2xr53y",1425480020,2015-03-04 14:40:20,"archiesteel"

So it is true that most corn is used for feed, but the increase in demand for corn ethanol was sufficient to push food prices higher on a global scale.

You are simply counting on the fact that no one will read them to say whatever you want about them. Either that, or you *really* don't understand what I'm saying.

&gt;The earth doesn't radiate IR at all.

Sure it does. Do you think the Earth is completely dark in the infrared spectrum? It receives energy from the sun (and, to a smaller degree, from its own internal heat) which is then radiated away.

These are pretty basic princples.

&gt;CO2 is opaque to IR incoming from the sun and that which would otherwise be reflected by the earth back to space.

If there was no greenhouse gases, the IR photons would be absorbed by the ground, and not reflected. You're thinking of visual light photons, which would be reflected to varying degrees depending on the albedo.

CO2 is indeed opaque to IR over a few meters, the exact value depending on the concentration of CO2 at that particular altitude. The more CO2, the longer an IR photon remains in the atmosphere; the less CO2, the shorter. The difference is more marked at night because it means temperatures fall slower than they would past sundown. You've noticed that it's usually colder at night, right? That's because there is no new influx of IR photons from the sun, just those being radiated by the ground and those being caught and re-emitted by greenhouse gases.

&gt;The earth does not store up that IR for release at night

I have never made that claim. That's not the reason why nights are warming up faster than days.

No

&gt; is every predicted change occurring? Are all of the weather changes we've seen part of predicted models? 

The models have effectively predicted both sides of all events for decades.  Thus unfalsifiable from the perspective of science.  Case in point, the Pause,  Which was predicted with extremely low confidence in some models. The true believers now pretend that the models that predicted the pause validate the dozens of others that did not.

&gt;can be intellectually honest when we attribute things to its influence? 

No.  The models are essentially a hypothesis/predictions.  To put any empirical weight to the conclusion of the models is akin to taking a prediction as empirical proof, an obvious anti-scientific situation.  

The only things we can say for certain.  

- Co2 is a more effective emitter and absorber of IR.  

- Co2 has dramatically increased the growth rate of plants via carbon fertilization. 

- Humans have had some non zero effect on the climate.(but its not proven if its stronger then natural variability)

That's it.  The temps can not be definitively nailed to Co2, and that theory is looking less likely by the day as the pause continues, despite an RPC 8.5 emission scenario, or higher.  Somewhere around half of all human emissions have taken place since the pause started, thus natural variability has to be stronger or nearly equal to our Co2 forcing.  

&gt;At what point (if any) do we say - ""we need to reevaluate our models""?

There are models for different things. There isn't one giant master model that ""predicts"" (we'll get to this later) the exact temperature, humidity, weather conditions, etc at any point on Earth at some time in the future. 

Different models have different accuracy. There are [canonical models](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n9/full/nclimate2310.html) for surface temperature which have shown to be relatively accurate. There are experimental models, which may or may not be that accurate (that's the point of research, right?).

There are models for [sea level](http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/modeling-sea-level-rise-25857988) which tend to be quite accurate. Models for atmospheric temperatures, i.e., lower troposphere temperatures gathered by satellites, haven't been that accurate. 

&gt;Up to and including ISIL terrorism... yeah.

I doubt a climate scientist showed this empirically. This is more a question of politics and sociology and understanding how people will behave as natural resources change. The Pentagon discusses the national security implications of climate change for a reason. All of this isn't part of the actual climate science, but more on the policy side of things.

Climate models don't predict things, they make projections. The two aren't the same, at all, despite the skeptics' deliberate conflation of the terms.

The problem with ""rejecting"" models is that it's not clear why the projection didn't pan out. Suppose I made a model that projected the damage done to my eye from you punching me. We could have a model of a fist (shape, protrusions, mass, skin thickness, etc), and a model of my head (heat shape, body fat %, etc, etc). 

To figure out how much damage done, we would run a number of projections with different parameter values for these variables (fist mass, body fat %, the angle your fist is coming at my face, the momentum). 

If you throw an uppercut, and that's something we didn't project (only expected hooks or jabs), does that mean the model is wrong? Or further, if we assumed the person weighed 150lbs, and could generate 50kgm/s2 of force, but in reality you can generate 100kgm/s2 of force, does that mean the model is wrong?

That's why models are evaluated in the long term. There's a lot of short-term variance that can make them appear to be wrong, i.e., short-term spike in volcanic activity (cooling effect) or short-term spike in solar activity.

&gt;Is there an integrated model?

Climate change is occurring faster than science can prove why it is happening. Yet the pole melts in summer and the glaciers continue to disappear etc. whether we can prove it on paper or not. Observable evidence doesn't count according to skeptics.

"2836","cp5p4rw","2","0","t3_2y1j81","There are certain things that are quantifiable:

- temperatures of the atmosphere, land and ocean surfaces, and the deep ocean.

- sea ice extent and volume.

- land ice (including glacier) melt.

- extreme weather event frequency and severity.

- sea level rise.

Model projections have been pretty good on some of these, pretty poor on others.  Temperatures have been well below the projected mean for both surface and most of the atmosphere.  There were few projections of ocean temperatures, so there's not much to compare.  If the present ""hiatus,"" as scientists use the term, persist for another 5 to 10 years, then temperatures will be outside the confidence interval of GCMs (General Circulation Models).

Arctic sea ice volume has decreased pretty significantly, so models have that one right.  Arctic ice extent has been in general decline since the 1970s, though I couldn't say that I know of models focused on extent rather than volume.  Antarctic sea ice volume and extent has increased, which was not expected by modellers.

I have not seen model projections for land ice.  They may be out there somewhere, but I am not aware of them.  Greenland is experiencing decline, as is the West Antarctic peninsula.  Himalayan glaciers have remained pretty static.

The IPCC SREX reported that there is very little evidence of increases in extreme weather events, either in frequency or severity.  John Holdren might want to read that sometime.

Sea level rise is at the top of projections from the early 90s, but seems not to have accelerated in recent years.  Previous projections were based primarily on land ice melt and thermal expansion.  The X factor is one is that has received some attention in the literature in recent years: terrestrial aquifer depletion.  So two of the three components of SLR are associated with climate change, one is not.

I think the heart of your questions is whether climate models, specifically GCMs, are worthwhile, or perhaps whether we put too much emphasis on them.  In my opinion, we do.  There is just too much parameterization going on for my comfort level.  I think it is unfortunate that so much stock was put in them to start with.  The climate is an incredibly complex, chaotic system and the amount of computing power to make real sense of it in terms of projections would require more computing power than our species could realistically build.  I think a much better approach to the whole subject would have been to focus on simple models and more data collection, including more instrumentation.

Seeking to place significance on what is, after all, a best guess predictive estimate rather than addressing what is concrete and actual in the present. This tactic is used to sway public opinion as most people have neither the time nor the expertise to question a seemingly scientific criticism. However as far as skeptics denying data, there is a front page post which shows pics of glaciers taken in 1920 and what those same glaciers are like today. Despite the stark contrasts that are dismaying to see, a quick scan of the comments on the Imgur pic site reveal several people who simply refuse to accept reality even when confronted by incontrovertible evidence. Some skeptics do deny data and evidence simply because they want to deny it exists. A self destructive and increasingly bizarre behavior which may be political at heart and not scientific. Who can say?

However I am beginning to have more hope as the American public no longer seems as easily swayed by these sleight of hand tricks as the current polls have recently shown that 68% of Americans believe that doing something global climate change is a priority.

So here you are repeating what's in those images. At least this time around you're being a lot more concise.

The average emperature of the Earth is about 15C. On the night side the temperature is far lower than the day side. So let's settle on 10C as the average night side temp. 10 degrees celsius is not energetic enough to radiate in the radio band, much less the IR. 

The earth gives off *heat*, not IR. Radiation is the action of an atom or molecule shedding energy by emitting energetic photons. Heat is transferred between particles by diffusion. It's diffusion that's at work on Sol III archie. Heat from the atmosphere rises and is lost to space via the simplest of methods.  That heat will escape completely unless it's absorbed by a ""greenhouse"" gas. That gas is water. Water, with it's high heat capacity traps heat close to the ground and keeps the night side from freezing. That's the reason why nights in a humid area are warmer than nights over a desert.  I've said many times before that you, and most of the AGW true-believers, don't have even a high-school level of science understanding. You don't know the difference between heat and IR. 

Warm air holds more water than cool air. Humidity is increased over the whole globe during this warming period. On the day side rapid heating causes water to rise. The highest clouds reflect incoming photons while those lower down trap heat below them. At night the low clouds sink lower do to the temperature difference resulting in a decreased volume of air below the clouds meaning that less heat escapes to apace. Increased humidity is the reason why nights are warming faster than the days. It has nothing to do with CO2 as CO2 only acts as a climate modifier while IR is incoming.

&gt;CO2 is indeed opaque to IR over a few meters, the exact value depending on the concentration of CO2 at that particular altitude.

You don't have a clue about the physics of the topic for which you claim such expertise. CO2 is opaque to IR in 2 narrow bands from 10-16 **microns**. *Water is also opaque to IR at that same frequency*. Altitude? No archie, the absorption band of CO2 does not vary with altitude.

&gt;The more CO2, the longer an IR photon remains in the atmosphere; the less CO2, the shorter.

An IR photon charging around in the atmosphere has no effect on temperture whatsoever. Until it's absorbed by some molecule it has no way of transferring energy. Incoming IR is either absorbed, transferring energy to an atom or molecule in the form of heat, or it's reflected back to space. IR is photonic energy and it behaves as any other photon. 

You have even noted that satelitte instruments record less outgoing IR in the 10-16 micron band due to more CO2 in the atmosphere. IR that would normally be reflected is being absorbed before leavng the atmosphere. IR is not absorbed and held for later release.  

&gt;The difference is more marked at night because it means temperatures fall slower than they would past sundown.

Read that again archie.That makes no sense at all.

&gt;You've noticed that it's usually colder at night, right? That's because there is no new influx of IR photons from the sun, just those being radiated by the ground and those being caught and re-emitted by greenhouse gases.

The images that you claim that I've misunderstood say what you've written above. So please archie, stop with the denials. [The images](http://imgur.com/a/j1mLL/all) show clearly that you're now repeating what you wrote before. 

Physics lesson archie:
*Opaque* means that the atom or molecule absorbs a photon. Once absorbed it heats the particle. The particle does not re-emit the photon unless it's sufficiently energetic such that it can not absorb any more of the incoming energy. An incoming photon of any energy can can pass through a particle (transparency), be refracted by it, or be absorbed. Nitrogen is transparent to most incoming photons but refracts at the blue end of the spectrum giving us blue skies. CO2 refracts at the red end giving pink skies on Mars. Transparancy to most wavelengths is what makes atmospheric gases visually transparent, as it does with glass and water. But that does not apply to all wavelengths which gives us the refractive properties of gasses, glass, and water.

&gt;I have never made that claim. That's not the reason why nights are warming up faster than days.
&gt;Again, I never said that the Earth stores IR for release at night. The absorbtion of energy/emission of IR photons is an ongoing process.

That's exactly what you said before, and what you're saying now archie. No 10C material radiates IR. 

&gt;I haven't. All I've confirmed here is that I know more about this topic than you.

I think We've pretty much put that fallacy to rest.

&gt;I've already told you I wouldn't report you in this old thread, because I don't want to bother /u/Will_Power with something no one else cares about.

Physics student here, that's totally wrong. At 10 degrees C the peak wavelength for radiation is 10 microns. You need to be unpractically (&lt;&lt;1K) cold before you stop radiating in the radio for practical purposes.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law

As you can see at 283 K a body will peak in the infrared. You can see in weather satellite images in the infrared the night side is still bright.

I stopped reading there (sorry, I know you spent a lot of time on the rest).

You *really* need to read up on thermal radiation. From the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation) (emphasis mine):

&gt;*Thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation generated by the thermal motion of charged particles in matter.* ***All matter with a temperature greater than absolute zero emits thermal radiation****. When the temperature of the body is greater than absolute zero, interatomic collisions cause the kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules to change. This results in charge-acceleration and/or dipole oscillation which produces electromagnetic radiation, and the wide spectrum of radiation reflects the wide spectrum of energies and accelerations that occur even at a single temperature.*

The ""heat"" we are talking about here *is* IR (Infrared Radiation); we don't actually see it, so it's not visible light. Why do you think they use infrared cameras as thermometers?

The ground *does* emit IR photons, and that process is different from conduction and convection. It is that infrared radiation, those infrared photons, that are captured by greenhouse gas molecules. The higher the concentration of greenhouse molecules in the atmosphere, the longer the IR photons stay in the atmosphere (and possibly hit the ground again). This means more lasting heat after the sun has gone down, which registers are a more pronounced warming at night than you'd expect if it was simply the sun being slightly hotter.

http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Sun1lite.htm

This passage directly supports my argument:

&gt;*Sunlight carries energy, which warms up the Earth and is the driving force behind all our weather and climate. As the ground is heated by sunlight, it begins to radiate, but* ***being too cool to radiate even a dull red, its radiation is in the infra-red range.*** *A hot pot or a hot laundry iron also radiates IR, and your hand can easily sense that radiation (as heat), if held close without touching.*

&gt;*Because the ground is nowhere as hot as the Sun, its emission is also much weaker. However, at any location the ground sends out radiation in all directions in the half-sky that is visible, while receiving radiation only from the small solar disk, covering only a small circle in the sky, 0.5 degrees across. Because of this, the total energy any area receives should be equal to the total energy it returns back to space.*

&gt;*Think it over! If all of Earth's heat comes from the outside (neglecting internal heat), and if it maintains a steady temperature, no other way exists. Of course, only the average temperature is steady.

Aww you're cute when you're trying to feel superior.

So now you've shown that not only do you not know what calculus is, you also don't know what algebra is.

"2907","cp7bute","1","0","t1_cp7aomg","That may well be true but that is not what I commented about to you. I tried to point out that observation in the field (a melting ice cap in summer is hard not to notice) is being ignored by skeptics who instead restrict their comments and criticisms to nit picking models. Models are scientific guesstimates used to puzzle out the causes of prior or future climate behavior.

Skeptics don't answer or respond to questions like that posed by a melting ice cap. They claim ill defined and dubious cycles/medieval warming and medieval cooling in the same breath/and assert that Mars is undergoing global warming (actually that is my favorite...lol) but they do not offer any proof.

Suddenly those who question the most minute failings of a model's usefulness have no problem excusing themselves of the same burden of proof as they subject others to. 

Moreover with this tactic they constantly attempt to switch a debate over verifiable evidence like long term observation and data collection in the field over to arguing about caricatures they themselves make.

Science does not rely on a few over the top activists but on raw quantifiable testable evidence. Skeptics consistently try to avoid discussing evidence in favor of straw man castigation. 

They will ignore the continuing and worsening situation of the polar ice cap melting in favor of hyperbolic insults and ridiculous insinuations (like that tens of thousands of scientists and professionals are in some conspiracy). 

They have no choice but to make themselves into caricatures of rational scientific based people otherwise they'd have to admit what they themselves can see right in front of their eyes. 

You can't fake a melting north polar ice cap... so they have begun to ignore it. Look for yourself how they do that. Citing past ices ages is absurd. Citing examples of the pole melting in previous eras is also absurd since the last time that happened was a 120,000 years ago and took a couple of millennia to happen and not only 30 years like we are doing. 

A flake wants to be taken seriously but we don't give people who believe half men/half lizards run the government, equal time in political debates. We watch as the skeptics fall away as even they can't escape seeing for themselves how bad it is starting to get and the smarter or saner ones remember that they and their children will have to suffer through the miseries of climate catastrophe. 

You may say that statement of mine is hyperbole and I would agree barring my citing some massive evidence in support of my assertion. Climate catastrophe? Why it would take some 'massive evidence' to prove that such a thing is happening? Something really big like...like ...like a melting ice cap! If the north pole starts to melt then call me, they laugh.


But it is melting and they aren't answering the phone!

- Carbon dioxide absorbs infrared radiation (IR) in three narrow bands of wavelengths, which are 2.7, 4.3 and 15 micrometers (µM). Peak absorption is at 15um.

- The earth does not radiate at 15um, will only radiate at 2.7 during the day, and will only radiate at 4.3 under conditions of extreme cold. 


Take a look at page 10 of [this presentation]( http://www.math.umn.edu/~mcGehee/Seminars/ClimateChange/presentations/2013-1Spring/20130212ThermalIRandCarbonDioxideintheAtmosphere.pdf) to see that overall absorption of IR by CO2 is slight at and around the 3um mark, while absorption is massive for water. Note that there is about 10x the amount of H2O in the atmosphere as CO2.


[A rising trend in global humidity has been observed](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI3816.1) and even the [favoured website agrees]( http://www.skepticalscience.com/humidity-global-warming.htm). [This article]( http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/WaterVapor/water_vapor3.php) also discusses the expected rise in humidity. Note that the Dai paper confirms that humidity rises at night by between 2-15%. A rise of 2% would take place over deserts (hot and cold) while the greatest rise would be over forests. So we can assume an overnight rise of 5%.as being within the typical range.

[This report] (https://www-pls.llnl.gov/?url=science_and_technology-earth_sciences-moisture) from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory tells us that humidity increase should be 6-7% per 1C temperature rise. Since the planet has warmed 0.6C we can assume an increase of 3% water volume.  

So let’s summarize why H2O is behind the rise in night temperatures:

- There is a total nightly volume increase of H2O of (approx) 200ppm.
- CO2 volume has risen by 120ppm and does not vary by time of day.
- CO2 is transparent to the IR wavelengths emitted by the earth most of the time, and which are nearly absent at night.
- H2O is opaque to the IR wavelengths emitted by the earth most of the time and opaque to those typical of nighttime temperatures. 

So, there is no question that CO2 has a negligible effect on the rise of night temperatures while water accounts for all of it.

I'm the same.

Your post is an improvement on your previous claims (i.e. that the Earth didn't radiate IR), but it still doesn't change  the basic fact that CO2 is the gas initially responsible, not Water Vapor. WV is a feedback, it is not a forcing. There would be a multi-decadal trend if it was just water vapor, as we are not putting additional water vapor in the atmosphere. If there is more WV in the atmosphere, it is because of CO2 warming (which is in fact what is predicted to happen).

&gt;The earth does not radiate at 15um, will only radiate at 2.7 during the day, and will only radiate at 4.3 under conditions of extreme cold.

[That is incorrect, as this graph from your link shows](http://fas.org/spp/military/program/warning/sbirs-brochure/fig-02.jpg). You can clearly see the ""warm day"" curve, which starts at around 2µm but peaks around 10µm. The ""very cold night"" curve is very similar. Both of these cover the spectrum of CO2, so CO2 does have impact.

&gt;This report from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory tells us that humidity increase should be 6-7% per 1C temperature rise. Since the planet has warmed 0.6C we can assume an increase of 3% water volume.

You realize this means you agree with strong climate feedbacks, right? Just making sure, because if you agree with that it becomes difficult to argue that man-made global warming isn't threatening us with a significant temperature increase.

&gt;So let’s summarize why H2O is behind the rise in night temperatures

H2O is a greenhouse gas, like CO2, so the fact that CO2 is making nights warm up faster than days *also* means that an increase in WV (caused by an initial warming due to CO2) will *also* make nights warm up faster than days.

If you want, we can agree on this: ""the effect of increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has caused nights to warm up at a faster pace than days."" That way we'll both be right. Deal?

&gt;So, there is no question that CO2 has a negligible effect on the rise of night temperatures while water accounts for all of it.

Yes, there is definitely a question about that. In fact, the effect of CO2 is *not* negligible, even though it may be smaller in magnitude than the effect of Water Vapor (in fact, it is probably similar to the current ratio between WV warming and CO2 warming, which WP gives as between 1.4:1 and 8:1).

We say CO2 is the cause because it is the forcing that has changed, while the WV portion is in fact a climate *feedback*, and not a forcing.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2vsmmw",1426007134,2015-03-10 17:05:34,"archiesteel"

And you're going where I thought you would. And why am I playing dumb here? Because, as you said, this is a dead thread and no-one is watching.

Way back in a previous thread you claimed that the earth radiated IR that was somehow stored by the earth and released at night. You turned youself inside out trying to explain *that* away.

archie, this is about the rise in temperature ""at night"". The observation is that warming has been greater at night. Whether or not that CO2 is initially responsible for overall warming is irrelevant. So what we're going to do here is get rid of all of the irrelevancies that you think are important to the issue at hand.

- Incoming solar radiation contains the full spectrum of IR.
- atmospheric gasses are transparent to most of that spectrum.
- CO2 is opaque to only 3 of those frequencies, leaving the rest of the incoming IR to be absorbed by other gases, the ground, and water. 
- Not all of the incoming IR is abosrbed at ground level. Some is reflected back and some is released through blackbody radiation. Some of that outgoing IR is captured by gases.
- At night there is no incoming solar IR. Which means that any trapping of IR must be that IR generated by residual heat only.
- There will be a few hot-spots at night with enough residual heat to radiate at 2.7um. There will also be a few spots at the poles cool enough to radiate at 4.7um. But the earth's night side is neither generally hot enough or cold enough to radiate at frequencies opaque to CO2.
- On the other hand, the earth's night side is just the right temperature to radiate at frequencies opaque to H2O.    

&gt;""the effect of increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has caused nights to warm up at a faster pace than days."" That way we'll both be right. Deal?

Nope. I haven't looked up the spectra for the other 3-atom molecules, but considering their concentrations we might very well ignre them. That leaves only water as having the physical properties needed to intercept outgoing IR. Since IR frequncy is temperature-dependant CO2 can't possibly be operating to warm the air at night. 

As I've shown you, the atmospheric increase of H2O, which is opaque to more IR frequencies, swamps that of CO2. That effect is more pronounced at night.

So what have you learned here archie? You've learned that:

- CO2 is not opaque over ""meters"" of IR. The full IR specrrum is shorter than 1 meter and CO2 is opaque to only 3 narrow bands.
- Most IR is not absorbed by the atmosphere but by the ground and the water (opacity being more broad for liquid water).
- H2O vapour is opaque to more frequencies both incoming and outgoing over the whole globe, not just on the day-side.
- H2O vapouor is 10x the volume of CO2 yet has more than 10x the effect due to more broad opacity.

I hope that finally clears it up for you, but I'm going to assume that you're going to object and claim that CO2 absorbs a wider spectrum than physics has determined.    ","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2vsmmw",1426161833,2015-03-12 12:03:53,"Oortcloud_2"

Nice try. You specifically said that the Earth wasn't warm enough to radiate IR at night.

You weren't testing me, you were wrong, because you are not very knowledgeable of this subject.

&gt;Way back in a previous thread you claimed that the earth radiated IR that was somehow stored by the earth and released at night. 

I never made that claim. If you're going to post screenshots, please provide the exact quote so that I may look if it is really there, and compare it to my own comments.

&gt;archie, this is about the rise in temperature ""at night"". The observation is that warming has been greater at night. 

So you agree that nights have been warming up faster than days, then? Since we haven't been adding new Water Vapor, and the only element that has changed over the multi-decadal trend is CO2, and CO2 is a greenhouse gas, and an increase in warming will cause the air to retain more Water Vapor, there is really no way you can claim it's not CO2.

&gt;Since IR frequncy is temperature-dependant CO2 can't possibly be operating to warm the air at night.

I'm sorry, but that's bullshit. The graph from the link you gave clearly shows that the spectrum is almost the same at night than during the day. You are denying evidence that you yourself provided.

&gt;CO2 is not opaque over ""meters"" of IR. The full IR specrrum is shorter than 1 meter

You're talking about two difrerent things, i.e. the distance a photon can travel without being captured by a CO2 (or other greenhouse gas) molecule, and the width of the IR specrum in micrometers.

&gt;H2O vapouor is 10x the volume of CO2 yet has more than 10x the effect due to more broad opacity.

Actually, the greenhouse effect of water vapour is only 1.4x to 8x that of CO2. That's because, molecule for molecule, CO2 is a more potent greenhouse gas than Water Vapor.

&gt;I hope that finally clears it up for you, but I'm going to assume that you're going to object and claim that CO2 absorbs a wider spectrum than physics has determined.

I'm claiming that you quickly read what you could about greenhouse gases when it became clear that you were completely wrong, and that you've failed to really understand what you were reading, which left you with the false impression that water vapor was a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2.

&gt;So you agree that nights have been warming up faster than days, then? Since we haven't been adding new Water Vapor, and the only element that has changed over the multi-decadal trend is CO2, and CO2 is a greenhouse gas, and an increase in warming will cause the air to retain more Water Vapor, there is really no way you can claim it's not CO2.

This is why I know that you're only here for the pleasure of a spat. I gave you links showing that water is being added to the atmosphere. In the past you've even agreed that warming has to add H2O to the air because warmer air can hold more moisture. That point is even agreed in the *SheepSci* link I provided. 

&gt;I'm sorry, but that's bullshit. The graph from the link you gave clearly shows that the spectrum is almost the same at night than during the day. You are denying evidence that you yourself provided.

I think that the new (for you) concepts that I've introduced must have shut down your brain. So let's go over both the facts and your misconceptions:

- You claimed that CO2 is opaque tp ""meters"" of IR frequency
- the entire IR band is less than one meter
- CO2 is opaque to only 3 bands of IR, all of which are contained in incoming solar radiatiton.
- IR that is reflected back to space can be absorbed by greenhouse gases where the frequency is right. Otherwise that IR escapes to space.
- At night there is very little incoming IR so what outgoing IR is trapped must be radiated by the earth.
- Outgoing IR frequncy is dependant on the temperature of the source. There are few sources hot enough at night to radiate at the 2.7um band, and few cool enough to radiate at 4.3um.
- Night temperatures are just right to radiate at frequencies absorbed by vapour.
- The total volume of water in the air has grown faster than the volume of CO2, and that volume is variable becoming greater at night.

&gt;You're talking about two difrerent things, i.e. the distance a photon can travel without being captured by a CO2 (or other greenhouse gas) molecule, and the width of the IR specrum in micrometers.

That's monkey-typing archie. It doesn't make any sense but you're hoping that it makes you sound all smart and intimidating. I don't believe that you can explain what any of that garbage means.

&gt;Actually, the greenhouse effect of water vapour is only 1.4x to 8x that of CO2. That's because, molecule for molecule, CO2 is a more potent greenhouse gas than Water Vapor.

Oh my, what an awesome attempt at recovery from disaster. More potent? There's laughable, and then there's pathetic. That's pathetic. The only difference is in the IR bands that they absorb and reradiate. Water is by far the more powerful due to it being opaque to more frequencies to which CO2 is not opaque.

No, you didn't. You were caught being wrong, and now you're apparently blowing up.

I'm not reading the entire thing, just responding to a few choice quotes.

&gt;I gave you links showing that water is being added to the atmosphere. In the past you've even agreed that warming has to add H2O to the air because warmer air can hold more moisture.

Except water isn't *directly* being added to the atmosphere, i.e. human activity isn't emitting more water vapor. Human activity releases CO2, which cases some initial warming, which means that the atmosphere can hold more water vapor, which then amplifies the warming a bit.

This is textbook AGW theory, and is consistent with what I've been saying.

&gt;You claimed that CO2 is opaque tp ""meters"" of IR frequency

I never made that claim. I said that CO2 is opaque to IR photons after those have travelled a few meters of *distance*. I can see why you were mistaken, so I'll just rephrase it: an IR photon can only travel a few meters without being absorbed by a CO2 (or another greenhouse gas) molecule.

&gt;That's monkey-typing archie. It doesn't make any sense

It's not monkey-typing, and it means exactly what it means. See above for my explanation.

&gt;Oh my, what an awesome attempt at recovery from disaster.

I don't have anything to recover from, you're the one crashing and burning.

&gt;More potent? There's laughable, and then there's pathetic. That's pathetic. 

Wow, you must be *really* fuming over there in front of your keyboard. Please try to keep it together.

It's neither pathetitc nor laughable, it's true: molecule for molecule, CO2 is more potent than Water Vapor.

&gt;Water is by far the more powerful due to it being opaque to more frequencies to which CO2 is not opaque.

That's not the only measure of a Global Warming Potential. CH4 is about 20x more potent than CO2, but it doesn't have 20x more absorbtion frequencies that are opaque to IR.

Tell you what: if you can provide to me info (based on peer-reviewed research) that shows that, molecule for molecule, WV is stronger than CO2, then I'll concede that very specific point. Note that, even if that was the case, it still wouldn't make WV as important as CO2 because WV stays much less longer in the atmosphere (it can precipitate easily, and maximum humidity is dependent on temperature).

From the article you linked to:

&gt;*So why aren't climate scientists a lot more worried about water vapour than about CO2? The answer has to do with how long greenhouse gases persist in the atmosphere. For water, the average is just a few days.*

&gt;*This rapid turnover means that even if human activity was directly adding or removing significant amounts of water vapour (it isn't), there would be no slow build-up of water vapour as is happening with CO2 (see Climate myths: Human CO2 emissions are tiny compared with natural sources).*

&gt;*The level of water vapour in the atmosphere is determined mainly by temperature, and any excess is rapidly lost. The level of CO2 is determined by the balance between sources and sinks, and it would take hundreds of years for it to return to pre-industrials levels even if all emissions ceased tomorrow. Put another way, there is no limit to how much rain can fall, but there is a limit to how much extra CO2 the oceans and other sinks can soak up.*

&gt;*Of course, CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas emitted by humans. And many, such as methane, are far more powerful greenhouse gases in terms of infrared absorption per molecule.*

Also this about Water Vapour being an important climate *feedback*:

&gt;*Water vapour will play a huge role in the centuries to come, though. Climate models, backed by satellite measurements, suggest that the amount of water vapour in the upper troposphere (about 5 to 10 kilometres up) will double by the end of this century as temperatures rise.*

&gt;*This will result in roughly twice as much warming than if water vapour remained constant. Changes in clouds could lead to even greater amplification of the warming or reduce it - there is great uncertainty about this. What is certain is that, in the jargon of climate science, water vapour is a feedback, but not a forcing.*

Let me ask you this. If according to the article (which, by the way, contradicts your claim that WV was responsible for ""95% of the warming"", which you have since removed):

&gt;*A simplified summary is that about 50% of the greenhouse effect is due to water vapour, 25% due to clouds, 20% to CO2, with other gases accounting for the remainder*

Considering this, are you saying there is average only 2.5x the amount of water vapour molecules are there are CO2 molecules? This would put the current average concentration of WV in the atmosphere at ~0.1%. Does that sound right?","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2vsmmw",1426346448,2015-03-14 15:20:48,"archiesteel"

I know your reading comprehension skills are sub-par, so I'll try to explain it again using simple words:

I said that **we** are not adding new Water Vapor to the hydrological cycle. I did *not* say Water Vapor had not increased. It *has* increased **because CO2 emissions have warmed the atmosphere**. So we are not directly responsible for the increase in WV, rather it is a natural feedback mechanism to the warming caused by our direct addition of anthropogenic CO2 to the atmosphere.

Do you understand the point now, or do I need to present in an even simpler fashion?

&gt;Even a five year old would see that those two statements are imcompatable.

No, I'm pretty sure a five-year-old would understand the distinction (but not you, apparently).

"3002","cpgkoiq","0","0","t1_cpgiz5e","&gt;Except water isn't directly being added to the atmosphere, i.e. human activity isn't emitting more water vapor. Human activity releases CO2, which cases some initial warming, which means that the atmosphere can hold more water vapor, which then amplifies the warming a bit.

Which is irrelevant to the discusssion archie. The issue is warming ""at night*. As I've shown you, it's the water, regardless of it's driver, which is causing the excessive warming on the night side compared to the day side. 

&gt;I never made that claim. I said that CO2 is opaque to IR photons after those have travelled a few meters of distance.

That's even worse than your previous claim. You're now saying that IR has to travel a certain distance before it can be absorbed? Shit archie, you must have a very high standard for ""ridiculous"".

&gt;I don't have anything to recover from, you're the one crashing and burning.

*""I am not! You are!""* Little kids to that archie.

&gt;Wow, you must be really fuming over there in front of your keyboard. Please try to keep it together.

I see that you've made no effort to refute. *I* made an effort archie, *you* just started monkey-typing.

&gt;It's neither pathetitc nor laughable, it's true: molecule for molecule, CO2 is more potent than Water Vapor.

I showed you an article from, what is to you, a reliable source. That source denies your argument. Water vapour is opaque to more IR frequencies so it's simply not possible for CO2 to be ""more powerful"".  

CH4 is not water vapour, nor is it CO2. Are you now claiming that nights are warming faster due to CH4? Let's make this easy; of the greenhouse gases CO2 is the least powerful. As you've pointed out, there are molecules that absorb more frequencies than CO2, and H2O is one of those. If you're going to claim that CH4 is more powerful than CO2 due to it's being opaque to more frequencies then you have to concede that H2O is more powerful than CO2 for the same reason. 

Are you now going to deny what you wrote? probably.

&gt;Tell you what: if you can provide to me info (based on peer-reviewed research) that shows that, molecule for molecule, WV is stronger than CO2, then I'll concede that very specific point. 

I already did. And you have already conceded that point by referencing CH4 and arguing that it is more powerful due to the same reason as H2O.

&gt;even if that was the case, it still wouldn't make WV as important as CO2 because WV stays much less longer in the atmosphere (it can precipitate easily, and maximum humidity is dependent on temperature).

Which is what **I've** been saying archie. Humidity has increased with temperature (you agree). I've shown you that the total volume of WV has increased several times that of CO2 during the current warming period. I've shown you that H2O atmospheric volume increases at night by a factor greater than the total increase in CO2 over the current warming period. I've shown that WV is opaque to frequencies emitted at night while CO2 is not. 

The *SheepSci* article says many things, including this:

&gt;The level of water vapour in the atmosphere is determined mainly by temperature, and any excess is rapidly lost.

Which is what I told you in the first place, that increased temperatures means higher humidity. The total volume increase of H2O is greater than CO2. 

&gt;Let me ask you this. If according to the article (which, by the way, contradicts """"your claim that WV was responsible for ""95% of the warming"", which you have since removed**

That is a fucking lie. I've removed nothing. Generally, you amuse me, but outright lies do piss me off. If I had removed it there would be a ""deleted"" note in the thread. When you need to resort to such falsehood you've lost. 

&gt;This would put the current average concentration of WV in the atmosphere at ~0.1%. Does that sound right?

Can't read links archie? NO, 0.1 is not even close. At 4000ppm H2O is 0.4% of the atmosphere while CO2 is a mere 0.04%.

I see you arguing against spectroscopy, atmospheric science, and your own favourite web page. You're not here to seek facts or understanding archie. You're here to force capitulation and declare that your confused view of scientific principle is in fact reality.

&gt;I don't think you're big or mean. You are small and completely unthreatening, which is why you almost always end up playing the victim card.

If I'm so small and unthreatening, why are you spending so  much time eradicating the problem? There's always a reason for stalking, which is usually the decision that the victim needs a good stalking. Do I respond to your comments archie? No. It doesn't help that you never leave any. You only ever ""reply"" in order to argue with opponants, or once in a while to squeal on ""deniers"". Am I your victim? Of course I am archie. The stalkee is *always* the victim of the stalker.

&gt;Nope, you're wrong on this thread, as you have been on every global warming thread you've ever participated in.

You think that because, as you said, you get all of your information from articles. 

&gt;NOAA made that statment. I provided evidence that you're wrong, but you're so afraid of losing face that you're now making stuff up to avoid admitting you were wrong (yet again). Your lack of maturity is quite amazing considering that you are allegedly older than me.

As I said, the publicity department got it wrong. And since you get your info from articles and not reports you go along with the article. Publicity departments have also been responsible for telling s that 2014 was the warmest year while the science was only 38% certain. But *you*, of course, believe the articles.

&gt;I've invested very little in this thread, sorry. I'm simply responding to you - something which your irrational mind is considering to be ""stalking"", and it doesn't matter what I do, you'll still blame me for it.

More importantly, I would like to draw attention to some of the faulty logic you used to arrive at your conclusions, and which is becoming increasingly widespread among people of your ideological disposition. In order to do this, we need to make an important distinction between the empirically verifiable existing data sets offered by scientists of various disciplines on the subject of climate change; and the straw man argument you are creating in an attempt to link the existing data to instances of inaccuracies among scientific predictions in the past.  
  The suggestion, that because the predictions of individual scientists have been wrong in the past, does not in any meaningful way refute the abundance of peer-reviewed data they are using to attempt to draw conclusions now. Nor does it undermine or otherwise outsource their authority on the disciplines in which they are trained, or necessarily disqualify them from attempting to make predictions now.

The reason I ask it that your dad might have grown up in the 1970s when popular media was telling everyone that an ice age was imminent.  I know plenty of people in their late 40s to early 60s who recall that quite plainly.  You too would probably look at claims of imminent warming with a jaundiced eye if you felt that a message you had been told as a teenager was being completely reversed by, for the lack of a better term, The Establishment.  Now of course climate science was in its infancy in the 1970s and the popular media is wrong all the time, so that really can't be blamed on the scientists of the time.  

One of the things I see around this issue, and the reason I created this sub, is that people have become so polarized on the topic that they talk past each other.  I would bet that you have an imagined set of beliefs you are projecting onto your dad, and I bet he has the same of you.  If you throw a bunch of links at him, I doubt you'll make much progress.

Instead, I would recommend you seek a path of understanding with him.  Ask yourself the following questions, then ask your dad the same questions, then compare answers.  This will allow you to discuss the topic in a mutually respectful way, with the ability to consult the published literature on each topic.  I think doing so will be much more productive than the argument from authority you are preparing.  Here are the questions:

1.  Is CO2 a greenhouse gas?

2.  Has there been an increase in CO2 since the industrial era?

3.  What is the direct effect of doubling atmospheric CO2?  (This is known as the Stefan-Boltzmann equilibrium.  To get specific, pre-industrial levels of CO2 were ~280 ppm; today it's ~400 ppm; a doubling would be ~560 ppm.)

4.  What are climate feedbacks and are they net negative or net positive?  (Negative feedbacks are those that reverse direction of a change; e.g., an air conditioner.  Positive feedbacks are those that accelerate a change; e.g., a stock market rally.)

5.  How much warming is expected per doubling of atmospheric CO2 (including feedbacks) at the time that number is reached?  (This value is known as TCR, or Transient Climate Response.)

6.  How much warming is expected per doubling of atmospheric CO2 once all feedbacks have stabilized?  (This is known as ECS, or Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity.)

7.  How many economically viable fossil fuel reserves remain and how much will they raise atmospheric CO2 if burned?

Good luck in your discussion.  I think if you go in with the right attitude you can have a really productive discussion with your dad.

Edit:
Here's what SKS says:

&gt;The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report summarized climate sensitivity as ""likely to be in the range **2 to 4.5°C** with a best estimate of about 3°C, and is very unlikely to be less than 1.5°C. Values substantially higher than 4.5°C cannot be excluded, but agreement of models with observations is not as good for those values.""

&gt;Individual studies have put climate sensitivity from a doubling of CO2 at anywhere between **0.5°C and 10°C**; however, as a consequence  of increasingly better data, it appears that the extreme higher and lower values are very unlikely.  In fact, as climate science has developed and advanced over time , estimates have converged around 3°C.  A summary of recent climate sensitivity studies can be found here. 

And here's what the [5th report says](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WGIAR5_SPM_brochure_en.pdf):

&gt;The equilibrium climate sensitivity quantifies the response of the climate system to constant radiative forcing on multi-century time scales. It is defined as the change in global mean surface temperature at equilibrium that is caused by a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely in the range **1.5°C to 4.5°C** (high confidence), extremely unlikely less than 1°C (high confidence), and very unlikely greater than 6°C (medium confidence)16. **The lower temperature limit of the assessed likely range is thus less than the 2°C in the AR4, but the upper limit is the same.** This assessment reflects improved understanding, the extended temperature record in the atmosphere and ocean,and new estimates of radiative forcing. {TS TFE.6, Figure 1; Box 12.2}

To be honest, SKS actually lists here that some people have climate sensitivity as low as .5 degrees, and the difference between the two years is only on the lower limit and is a difference of .5 degrees. so yeah, you're really going to have to present some evidence here that they haven't updated their page because it ""fits their narrative"".

Sure, but John Cook isn't the one who writes or maintains all of the content there. As I said, there's a *lot* of content there.

[Here's](http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-stopped-in-1998-intermediate.htm) another perfect example of this.

See that? It doesn't contain the latest information about 2014 most likely being the warmest year on record. Most certainly the 2014 findings would support their narrative, right?

&gt;I have no interest in visiting their site for more.

Can this be summed up as ""No, I only have one example""?

&gt;Yes. AR5 reduced the low end of the likely range and didn't cite a most likely value. That's a pretty significant change, but Cook and friends opt to leave that out of the discussion years after the fact.

So? The SKS page on climate sensitivity isn't titled ""IPCC's View on Climate Sensitivity"", but rather, a discussion on the science behind climate sensitivity. It cites relevant research that shows the sensitivity being as low as .5 degrees; much smaller than what the IPCC gives. 

There has been additional research too on climate sensitivity that the SKS page doesn't contain. Why? Because it would be too exhaustive for them to maintain real-time updates on all of the content. 

&gt;Do you really not understand the significance of that change?

Given that they have relevant research there showing climate sensitivity as low as .5 degrees, and as high as 10 degrees, an update to the IPCC's low-end is pretty meaningless since 1) it already falls within the range that they listed; 2) the IPCC didn't change its upper bound; 3) there has been plenty of research since this page was created that's germane and hasn't been updated to the SKS Website; and 4) Latest information that supports their narrative hasn't been updated for previous pages, i.e., the warmest year on record. 

&gt;No, I don't. You asked for an example, and I provided it. Are you seriously trying to argue that Cook and his crusher crew are making any sort of effort to present a balanced argument?

You made the statement that SKS is deliberately avoiding updating their page because it doesn't fit their narrative. All you've shown is that they haven't updated their page to contain relevant research since the page was created. You haven't shown at all that this is a deliberate ploy to mis-inform the public. I've shown a counter example demonstrating a clear instance where an SKS update would support their narrative, and yet they haven't update their pages to reflect this new information.

That's literally what it is: SKS doesn't always update their past Web pages as new research is presented.

No, we are talking about confidence intervals and what is most likely.  You are simply resorting to sophistry to talk about the very large but unlikely range.  Also the implication of shifting the lower boundary of a gamma distribution is that the most likely value of ECS must drop from 3.0°C, which is what Cook and friends *still* maintain.

Being incorrect doesn't make you a liar.

&gt;No, we are talking about confidence intervals and what is most likely. You are simply resorting to sophistry to talk about the very large but unlikely range.

Sorry, but this is very much an example of ""moving the goalpost"". What we're talking about is how SKS discusses climate sensitivity in relation to CO2. What we aren't doing is debating the issue of climate sensitivity itself. 

&gt;And I've given you the tools to understand the people and their narrative.

But at least one of your examples hasn't been able to hold up to scrutiny, right? Let's go through the list of hypotheses that you and I are presenting along with the evidence supporting said hypothesis:

**Your statement:**

SKS is deliberately avoiding presenting new information on climate sensitivity because one new piece of information doesn't fit their narrative.

**Your evidence:**
 Out of 10 or so citations that SKS lists showing a range of climate sensitivities between .5 and 10, the IPCC's latest report changed their sensitivity from (2.0 to 4.5) to (1.5 to 4.5). 


**My statement:**

SKS doesn't always go back and keep old pages up-to-date with the latest research. One could likely find examples where new research *would* support their narrative and they have also not updated said pages to reflect this.

**My evidence:**

The Web page on whether or not the Earth has warmed since 1998. Given that numerous climate agencies have reported 2014 as the most likely warmest year, this would most certainly support SKS's narrative. For some reason, you've ignored this counter example. 

Any reasonable person would conclude that my hypothesis has better support, and given the large number of pages SKS has that *aren't* updated with the latest research, it's hard to find evidence that they didn't update the climate sensitivity page with one additional citation simply because they want to ""mislead their readers"". 

Again: this is exactly why climate deniers are belittled. When the evidence doesn't support their statements, they start to claim wild conspiracy theories about data manipulation and that sort of thing. ","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2zau9o",1426629609,2015-03-17 22:00:09,"fartlex_m"

One of core tenets of the positions advanced by those of the skeptical position is that increased CO2 might induce warming that would cause an increase of water vapor (an aerosol) in the atmosphere that would lead to increased cooling. This ignores that increased water vapor would suggest larger storms, increased flooding.

However the reality is that according to the CO2 levels taken from the most reliable ice cores going back nearly a million years, we are now adding CO2 at levels nearly 1,000s times faster a year than in recent history. We might argue that 400ppm is the acceptable level, but that assumes its going to stop, or that we KNOW what levels are actually safe and wont come with serious consequences.

And here's where you trip yourself up with your panicky responses archie. You're on record saying that none of the current warming is natural.

We do not have the ability to accurately know exactly how bad it may really be. Somewhere out there is some fact that we have missed or that our scientific analysis has inadvertently omitted. You almost get the feeling that something very bad is looming ever closer and we don't even see it yet. Like this trough allowing warmer water under the ancient glacial ice. 

It wasn't all that long ago that we were told that while Greenland's ice cap was melting that it would be a thousand years before the Antarctic ice cap would be affected. 

What has it been 10 years since and now what are we being told about the Antarctic ice cap? 

What is waiting for us to catch up to out there another ten years into the future that we don't even look for yet? Back when they said a thousand years etc. this trough already existed but we didn't know about it yet.

I fear you are going down the same divisive path with your best friend as that person was with his/her father.  Here is how I responded to that person:

----
Do you mind if I ask how old you are?

The reason I ask it that your dad might have grown up in the 1970s when popular media was telling everyone that an ice age was imminent.  I know plenty of people in their late 40s to early 60s who recall that quite plainly.  You too would probably look at claims of imminent warming with a jaundiced eye if you felt that a message you had been told as a teenager was being completely reversed by, for the lack of a better term, The Establishment.  Now of course climate science was in its infancy in the 1970s and the popular media is wrong all the time, so that really can't be blamed on the scientists of the time.  

One of the things I see around this issue, and the reason I created this sub, is that people have become so polarized on the topic that they talk past each other.  I would bet that you have an imagined set of beliefs you are projecting onto your dad, and I bet he has the same of you.  If you throw a bunch of links at him, I doubt you'll make much progress.

Instead, I would recommend you seek a path of understanding with him.  Ask yourself the following questions, then ask your dad the same questions, then compare answers.  This will allow you to discuss the topic in a mutually respectful way, with the ability to consult the published literature on each topic.  I think doing so will be much more productive than the argument from authority you are preparing.  Here are the questions:

1.  Is CO2 a greenhouse gas?

2.  Has there been an increase in CO2 since the industrial era?

3.  What is the direct effect of doubling atmospheric CO2?  (This is known as the Stefan-Boltzmann equilibrium.  To get specific, pre-industrial levels of CO2 were ~280 ppm; today it's ~400 ppm; a doubling would be ~560 ppm.)

4.  What are climate feedbacks and are they net negative or net positive?  (Negative feedbacks are those that reverse direction of a change; e.g., an air conditioner.  Positive feedbacks are those that accelerate a change; e.g., a stock market rally.)

5.  How much warming is expected per doubling of atmospheric CO2 (including feedbacks) at the time that number is reached?  (This value is known as TCR, or Transient Climate Response.)

6.  How much warming is expected per doubling of atmospheric CO2 once all feedbacks have stabilized?  (This is known as ECS, or Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity.)

7.  How many economically viable fossil fuel reserves remain and how much will they raise atmospheric CO2 if burned?

Good luck in your discussion.  I think if you go in with the right attitude you can have a really productive discussion with your dad.

Not really. Antarctica is gaining sea ice, but it is losing land ice.

The sea ice extent gain may in fact be a result of warming temperature and decreasing land ice.

&gt;***NASA Study Shows Global Sea Ice Diminishing, Despite Antarctic Gains***

&gt;*Sea ice increases in Antarctica do not make up for the accelerated Arctic sea ice loss of the last decades, a new NASA study finds. As a whole, the planet has been shedding sea ice at an average annual rate of 13,500 square miles (35,000 square kilometers) since 1979, the equivalent of losing an area of sea ice larger than the state of Maryland every year.*

&gt;*“Even though Antarctic sea ice reached a new record maximum this past September, global sea ice is still decreasing,” said Claire Parkinson, author of the study and climate scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. “That’s because the decreases in Arctic sea ice far exceed the increases in Antarctic sea ice.”*

That seems to support *my* argument, not yours.

&gt;These changes on sea ice cannot be scientifically explained by a ""man made climatechange""

Sure they can. Human activity is causing the temperature of the planet to go up (up to 0.8C from the pre-industrial average). It is only natural that more ice would melt given a rise in atmosphere and sea temperatures.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_30atd1",1427381267,2015-03-26 14:47:47,"archiesteel"

Yep, that'd be me.  We were told we were heading into another ice age because all the pollution we were putting into the atmosphere was blocking the sun.  The winter of 1977-78 was horrible in the U.S. so the hype got worse and worse.  Walter Cronkite talked about it frequently on the evening news.  The solution was massive government spending to fight the changing climate.

Then we get told that the same pollution that was causing another ice age was now causing the world to get warmer.  Temperatures would cause the ice sheets to melt.  Sea level would rise.  There would be more hurricanes, more flooding, less snow.  Entire island nations would be wiped off the map.  The solution was massive government spending to fight the changing climate.

So yeah, after living through this and seeing the scientific consensus getting exactly 0.0% of their predictions correct, us old-timers are skeptical of what's being spewed.  The climate does exactly what it wants to do but the ""solution"" always seems to be the same.

Luckily, the Nasa page Wordpress links to DOES talk about more recent data:

Regarding the Arctic:

&gt; The monthly average Arctic sea ice extent for February was the third lowest in the satellite record. Through 2015, the linear rate of decline for February extent is 2.9% per decade.

Regarding the Antarctic:

&gt;  The sea ice extent trend for February for 1979 to 2015 shows an increase of 5.0%  per decade. However, Antarctica’s sea ice extent is highly variable. As recently as 2011, Antarctic sea ice extent was at near-record low levels for the summer minimum.

&gt; The debate continues regarding the cause of the recent Antarctic trends, but the best explanation so far involves a combination of strengthening low pressure in the eastern Ross Sea (the Amundsen Sea Low) and the eastern Weddell Sea, and a persistently positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode. The freshening of surface seawater around Antarctica may also play a role.

If I were making the positive assertion, I would have presented much more than one paper, but I come from the mathematical world where a theorem is disproven by a counterexample.  So I think it is incumbent upon you to address the paper itself and show why your original positive assertion still holds.  You probably disagree, and I don't want to philosophize further with you on how many papers are good enough.

Regarding your assertion that other studies show solar influence is lower, I would say this.  Studies that begin with adding up terrestrial and atmospheric factors for radiative balance models only look at TSI.  Indirect solar influences on climate are outside of the scope of those models, so of course they find what they assumed to start with: TSI changes are negligible.

Regarding your assertion that the IPCC report would reflect (pun?) solar impacts, I again disagree.  Much of the research in solar/climate forcing is nascent at best.  The IPCC reports can only report what is current as of a certain date, which is typically a couple of years before publication date.  Consider the work that has been done on climate sensitivity since AR5 as an example.

So perhaps we can find some agreement on this point: it's premature to say that solar has negligible impact on climate because the science is not yet well established in this regard; similarly, we cannot say with strong confidence that solar influences on climate are large, for the same reason.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_30atd1",1427474139,2015-03-27 16:35:39,"Will_Power"

Lots of people who aren't scientists like to claim otherwise, as this subreddit frequently demonstrates, but arguments against climate change are frankly laughable to scientists. How do I know this? Most of my family members are scientists, several of them climate scientists. Most of my family friends are climate scientists. I, (though not a climate scientist myself), work with climate scientists every day. When climate scientists see the sorts of arguments than deniers trumpet, they just kind of laugh and sigh. It's the equivalent of someone going to an oncologist and saying ""but Dr., there's no way I have terminal cancer because my temperature is normal,"" or taking your car to a mechanic and saying ""dude I don't need a new engine, all the interior lights work."" So argue climate change if you will, but there's simply not much more to be said there.

So that's the first point: burning fossil fuels emit CO2 which is largest driver of the current greatest threat to humans. But even if we were to ignore that...

- Fossil Fuels are a finite resource. To be sure, there's probably still a lot left, but the problem is that it's getting harder and more expensive to extract it. Back in the day (1900-1970s), it was pretty cheap and easy to extract huge quantities of oil, which meant that regardless of the price, oil companies were probably making a profit and everything was fine and good. Now we have to resort to more expensive options like fracking and offshore drilling to get our oil. These processes are very expensive, often dangerous, and as those oil deposits become scarce, we'll have to resort to even more expensive options. Most of the technological advances in oil extraction have been made to extract oil in trickier, more expensive ways. 

- By contrast, the technological advances in solar have been to make solar panels cheaper and more efficient. Same goes with wind. It's never going to be more expensive or difficult to utilize solar or wind because they are steady, infinite (for several million years at least) resources. So while oil gets more and more expensive to extract, solar and wind get cheaper and cheaper. Solar panels are 100 times cheaper today than they were in the late 90s. That's crazy. My neighbors have a pretty big solar array that they paid 8k for in 2003. Just last year, they broke even. Average savings for today's homeowners, however, is about $20,000 over 20 years. In Hawaii it's $60,000. That's amazing. 

- Also take into account the fact that every stage of the oil extraction, refining, and burning process is fairly dangerous and very messy. You need highly trained people working basically every stage, and a ton of maintenance. Solar just requires manufacturing and installation. Wind requires a degree of maintenance, but not nearly to the extant that oil does. 

- Then there are the non-climate environmental factors. There's a long history of negative, sometimes fatal impacts of oil/coal plants/refineries on nearby populations (of people as well as animals). They emit harmful gasses, harmful byproducts, harmful waste etc etc. And that isn't even mentioning oil spills. The only thing solar panels and wind turbines emit is electricity.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_30js25",1427505748,2015-03-28 01:22:28,"forrey"

How do you reconcile the obvious impossibility of large scale renewable energy with the obvious necessity of cheap energy to power a global modern economy?  You can't... which is why I love Fossil fuels, because without them, we would be living in horrible conditions.

As for the threat of climate change... That would pale in comparison to a world wide energy shortage and resulting economic and societal collapse that would result from the proposed solutions to climate change.  Something is not a threat... if the answer to the threat is worse then the initial problem.

Without fossil fuels, even the most basic of natural disaster mitigation would be nearly impossible and we would be economically screwed just trying to stop natural forces (global hunger, coastal erosion, wild fires, hurricanes, etc).

Distributed renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuel in the developing world where the poorest people live. The expansion of RE in the developing world is limited by the rate of adoption of RE policies, and the ability of the human side (technical and financial expertise) to ramp successfully. For example, I was on the start-up team for the first 1 MW utility scale solar installed in India in 2010. Here we are, just 5 years later, and they're installing 5 GW per year of solar at kwh prices that are cheaper than Australian coal. Plus, 70% of the cost of solar is money spent in the developing country, rather than with fossil fuel where 70% of the energy money is exported to buy fuel. Look at it another way: Today, there are roughly 1.5 billion worldwide that have no access to affordable energy at all.

You could argue that the walrus isn't important because it isn't threatened today with extinction - to that, in addition to saying ""F-U"", I would say you are totally wrong. Walruses are the globes ""bioturbators"", dredging over 3 million tons of sea floor every year as they forage for food. The bioturbation makes it possible for fish and crabs to survive. Losing the Arctic ice is a really big ecological disaster in the making.

So, even though the Arctic is losing ice while the Antarctic is gaining ice, don't be fooled by those claiming that there isn't a problem because they cancel each other out.

Antarctic ice gain is simpley because the glaciers are moving 600% faster than they used to flooding the sea with fresh water than freezes at higher temperature; plus, the sea ice extent is exacerbated by a more poleward jet stream that pushes the ice farther out to sea.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_30datk",1427512185,2015-03-28 03:09:45,"Johnny_Walrus"

- IPCC says that will cause ~7F warming.

- At 30 billion tons per year burned...  We could stop all emissions today (and destroy civilization as we know it) and it would make a negligible 2.5 F dent in the warming.

With regards to extreme weather events, this is absolutely what we're seeing right now.  Records all over the world are being broken for floods, droughts, heat waves, cold snaps, snow fall.  Right now in California, we're facing one of the worst droughts on record, and we've just had our warmest winter on record.  2014 is going down as the hottest year ever.   You can also google ""Kashmir floods"", ""Brazil Drought"", ""Polar Vortex"", or ""Britain's Floods"" to get a glimpse of other recent extreme events.  

In fact, the damage caused by extreme events is increasing, not decreasing.  Losses have risen from $50 billion a year in the 1980s to $200 billion a year in the last decade.  This is according to a World Bank report that you can read [here.](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/11/18513435/building-resilience-integrating-climate-disaster-risk-development-world-bank-group-experience-vol-1-2-main-report).  

Now, sea level rise.  Yes, you are correct in that sea levels have risen about 7-9 inches since 1850.  The troubling part of this is the fact that the rate is accelerating.  The 20th century average is 1.7mm per year.  From 1993 to the present, the rate is 3.2mm per year, almost double!

There's a lot we still don't know about sea level rise. While we know that the rate of increase will keep accelerating, there is a lot of debate over exactly by how much.  Your most conservative estimates puts the total sea level rise at 3 ft by 2100, while there are other scientists out there projecting that the rise could go as high as 6 ft by that time.  

3 ft doesn't sound like much. You may be wondering why there are so many maps out there showing flooded cities under 10 and 25 feet of sea level rise.  That's because we're concerned not just about what happens in our own lifetime, but in the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren.

I have stated time and again that the big ENGOs (Greenpeace, UoCS, Sierra Club, etc.) do more to harm their own cause through their opposition to nuclear power than do any fossil fuel companies.  In fact, fossil fuel interests oppose nuclear power as well, so you've got ENGOs siding with their supposed enemies in opposition to a power source that is safer (per MWh produced) than any other, and emits zero CO2 to boot.

Stranger still, the ENGOs are expressively contradicting some very well known climate scientists, who have written an open letter of support for nuclear power:

http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists-letter/

Jim Hansen, one of the signatories, is actually calling for a boycott of ENGOs until they reform their position on nuclear power:

From that article:

&gt;It is not always easy to speak truth to power, but all citizens have the opportunity if they choose. I have one minor, easy suggestion for you to consider, and another requiring more effort.
&gt;
&gt;The first concerns ""Big Green,"" the large environmental organizations, which have become one of the biggest obstacles to solving the climate problem. After I joined other scientists in requesting the leaders of Big Green to reconsider their adamant opposition to nuclear power, and was rebuffed, I learned from discussions with them the major reason: They feared losing donor support. Money, it seems, is the language they understand. Thus my suggestion: The next time you receive a donation request, doubtless accompanied with a photo of a cuddly bear or the like, toss it in the waste bin and return a note saying that you will consider a donation in the future, if they objectively evaluate the best interests of young people and nature.

With that out of the way, let's be pragmatic for a minute.  I think it's time we look at emissions reduction per dollar invested.  It's no secret that the problem with solar and wind is their intermittency.  The more solar and wind are added to the grid, the more costly dealing with this problem becomes.

https://theconversation.com/counting-the-hidden-costs-of-energy-12710

From that source:

&gt;The report defines grid-level system costs as the total costs (on top of plant-level costs) to supply electricity at a given load and given level of security of supply. These additional costs include the extra investment to extend and reinforce the grid, plus the costs for increased short-term balancing and for maintaining the long-term adequacy of electricity supply in the face of intermittent variable renewables.

No, it would not, at least not by any amount detectable by our current instrumentation.  Just how much are you expecting the sea levels to rise?  

Look, there's about [25 million square kilometers](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/index.html) of sea ice on the earth.  If that all melted, we would see [only 4 cm total of sea level rise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_shelf#Ice_shelf_disruption).

No, I'm not saying that.  Please read the whole thread in context.  The person I was responding to was panicked over the headline number.  I commented that there's no indication of SLR acceleration, so maybe panic shouldn't be the default reaction.  I'm quite happy to note a loss in ice shelf mass.

Yes, nuclear power has received subsidies in the past and probably still does.  Here's one of the naughty little truths about energy: all forms of energy receive subsidies.  In the case of nuclear, the government wanted some of the byproducts of nuclear reactions for weapons programs, satellite batteries, etc., so subsidies have been the order of the day.

&gt;Has nuclear power historically been heavily subsidized compared to solar?

It depends on how you measure it.  Of course nuclear's total subsidy bill will exceed that of solar, because we've been producing a lot of nuclear power for a lot longer.  Thus, I think the most appropriate measure is subsidy dollars per kWh produced:

http://environmentblog.ncpa.org/which-energy-source-receives-the-largest-subsidy/

Because contribution to sea level rise from ice shelves is negligible.  

&gt; You are getting these numbers from where?

Ooo, my bad.  I went back to the original article and the **acceleration** is 7 km per year, not the total loss value.  This is on top of the base rate of 30-50 km per year.  From the write up in [Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/antarctica-s-ice-shelves-thin-threaten-significant-sea-level-rise/), it says:

&gt; What they found was that the massive ice shelves were losing, on the whole, about 30 to 50 cubic miles of ice per year over that span. And in that period, the rate of ice loss accelerated by an average of 7 cubic miles per year.

So, this would mean the total loss is between 1600 to 1980 miles over 18 years.  Or, between 0.0004 and 0.0005 cm of sea level rise in total over 18 years.  I would still consider that negligible.    

Your original post said ""I would take this with a grain of salt"" which seemed to call into question whether the claims made by the article was true or not.  So, you actually meant to say 'no sea level rise from this, therefore no reason for alarm'?  

Ok, I can switch debate gears.  The reason why we would be concerned is the role that ice shelves play in buttressing the rest of the land ice behind it. Ice shelves provide back pressure, which slows the rate of land ice melt.  Once land ice begins melting at an accelerated rate, then you would see a significant increase in sea level rise.

The original article didn't give absolute values, just a headline number of 18%.  That's why I said, ""take this with a grain of salt.""  The guy was panicked over a number with no context.  As you've demonstrated here, it's nothing to panic over.

Except calving events regularly reduce that backpressure.  We are not witnessing anything new here.

&gt;Ice shelves provide back pressure, which slows the rate of land ice melt.

The land ice in the interior doesn't warm enough to melt.  It flows under pressure.

I'm sorry if I'm not understanding.  Perhaps you can demonstrate what kind of sea level rise we should be seeing from an 18% decrease in the Antarctic sea ice shelf?  

I think you might be missing the point of the article.  Ice shelves do calve, but after calving go through a period of recovery.  So, while they 'ebb' and 'flow', the shelf itself is supposed to be in a general state of equilibrium.  

However, that's not what we're seeing.  We're seeing a steady, and accelerating decline. Steady, accelerating decline over almost two decades doesn't really count as normal calving. 

And what do you think will happen once those land-based glaciers flow into the sea?  Land based ice doesn't currently displace any water (unlike sea ice).  So once that ice is added into the ocean, sea levels go up.  Ice shelves help stop the flow of that ice into the ocean, which is why we need them, and why it's so alarming that we seem to be losing them.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_30n4ih",1427756951,2015-03-30 23:09:11,"pocketfrog77"

This is the very thing I've been trying to get at.  The original article didn't clarify how much of the shelf we've seen that 18% decline in.  The first comment was very handwringy, so I suggested caution.  As you demonstrated, it's nothing to panic about.

&gt;So, while they 'ebb' and 'flow', the shelf itself is supposed to be in a general state of equilibrium.

That sentence is contradictory.  Yes, you can take the mean over a long time period, but there is no state of equilibrium.

&gt;However, that's not what we're seeing. We're seeing a steady, and accelerating decline.

We are seeing a decline over a very short time period.  It's far too soon to make a meaningful projection.  I've seen people project Arctic sea ice trends over similar data periods.  They said the Arctic would be ice free this year.

&gt;And what do you think will happen once those land-based glaciers flow into the sea?

They are always sliding into the sea.  They always have been, at least during the present ice age.  As mass builds up from precipitation, the land ice flows outwards.

&gt;So once that ice is added into the ocean, sea levels go up.

Now you are back to my argument.  If this is already happening, we should be seeing an acceleration in SLR.  We aren't.

&gt;Ice shelves help stop the flow of that ice into the ocean, which is why we need them, and why it's so alarming that we seem to be losing them.

The article seemed pretty clear that we would not have any direct effect.  Anyway, if we're actually in agreement here, then let's move on and leave this point.

I am not trying to demonstrate that there's nothing to worry about, only that there wouldn't be any direct sea level rise from ice shelf melt.  It's the *indirect effects* that are cause for concern.

&gt; There is no state of equilibrium.

Perhaps a better way to think of it is mass balance.  Ice shelves calve, and recover.  Ideally, they should be maintaining a general mass balance despite these losses and gains.  That's not what we're seeing here.  There is an accelerating negative trend to the mass balance of these ice shelves. So no, they are certainly not in equilibrium.  

&gt; They are always sliding into the sea.  

In a stable glacier-ice shelf system, the ice shelf slows and can even stop the flow of that glacier, offsetting gravity with buoyancy.  Without the back pressure from ice shelves, glaciers would flow much faster into the ocean.  We know this happens because we saw the mechanics of it play out when the Larsen B ice shelf collapsed.  The glaciers it was supporting began to flow much faster into the sea, losing a great deal of volume since they were flowing faster than precipitation could build them up.  More ice in the water = higher sea levels.

&gt;If this is already happening, we should be seeing an acceleration in SLR.

Actually we totally are.  For the first 80 years of the 20th century, the rate of sea level rise was about 1.7mm per year (perhaps as low as 1.2mm, given some recent studies).  The last 20 years has seen a rate almost double that, and according to the IPCC report, the sea level increase will continue to accelerate.  Scientists are not really certain how fast the rate will continue to increase, but news like this seem to suggest it may be at the upper end of predictions in the IPCC report.

Again, the observational time period is so short that I hesitate to declare a definitive acceleration.  Is there acceleration within the short-term data?  You bet.  There was also acceleration in SLR during the 20th century, but that has ceased.

There was very little hype in the 70's and 80's, and for the most part the science at the time was pretty accurate, given the uncertainties and the limits of the computing power at the time. There were pretty big questions about the relative strengths of different feedbacks; those questions still exist but we've refined our understanding of them significantly.

The elephant in this room is the trope about ""scientists believed we were headed into another ice age in the 70's!"" This is, for the most part, untrue. The majority of climate scientists at the time predicted warming, a projection that has held up well over time. There were a handful of papers that estimated that negative feedbacks would outpace positive ones, leading to overall cooling; this wasn't an unreasonable theory but didn't stand up to the test of time.

It's based off of climate models, and is common knowledge (an argument that you have used before so don't nit pick)

&gt;Continental glaciers effect only local areas. 

[1.4 billion people](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5984/1382.short) is not a ""local area"" as they depend on the glaicers of the himilayas to moderate the flow of rivers originating out of them, especially in the drier seasons. Don't forget that [glaciers](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hyp.7409/abstract;jsessionid=08E5AF9A7D7874518A7F505807A200E6.f01t02) feed the main rivers used for irrigation in Pallisers triangle, which is a very dry region of the canadian prairies that produces most of Canada's grains.

So your statement that continental glaciers only effects local areas, is completely ignorant.

&gt;CO2 fertalization and warmer temps has led to an increase in vegetation globally.

No it has not increased vegetation all around the world, a very good example of this is looking at B.C, norther alberta and Alaska, all showed a drop in photosynthesis, and SE asia showed no change to a drop in photosynthesis rates as well.

&gt;There is no evidence that the oceans are warming or altering pH beyond normal variability.

Please provide a source for this claim.

&gt;  All coral bleaching has occurred in areas of high pollution from run-off and ocean dumping of garbage

Source please because [corral bleaching](http://www.downtoearth.org.in/image/20021130/19-map.jpg) is happening all around the world. As you can see coral bleaching occurs from warmer sea [temperatures and acidification](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6041/418.short). Also warming sea temperatures changes the microbiota of the coral colony. 

&gt;Prior to the late 20th century, data-sets have been scarce for pretty much every topic we wish to name[...] In observational science we must compare current observations to past.

You do realize that humans have been tracking animal migrations for centuries right? Hunters need to know migration patterns of their prey, fur traders need to seasonality ranges of the animals they are trapping, and nomadic cultures know the seasonal movements of their prey. It is not as tracking the ranges of species is a new field of study, so we can compare the movements of species to past observations.

&gt;We decided to combine our energy innovation study’s best-case scenario results with Hansen’s climate model to see whether a 55 percent emission cut by 2050 would bring the world back below that 350-ppm threshold. Our calculations revealed otherwise. **Even if every renewable energy technology advanced as quickly as imagined and they were all applied globally, atmospheric CO2 levels wouldn’t just remain above 350 ppm; they would continue to rise exponentially due to continued fossil fuel use. So our best-case scenario, which was based on our most optimistic forecasts for renewable energy**, would still result in severe climate change, with all its dire consequences: shifting climatic zones, freshwater shortages, eroding coasts, and ocean acidification, among others.

Judith Curry followed that with a good history of climate sensitivity and how the Stevens paper contributes to reducing uncertainty about the issue:

From her conclusions at the bottom of the article:

&gt;Our methods of inferring climate sensitivity – using GCM climate models and energy balance models – are leading us to reject the highest values of climate sensitivity that were determined using methods or models that have been deemed erroneous.
&gt;
&gt;In short, the ‘fat tail’ of climate sensitivity is getting skinnier and shorter.  Does this imply that ‘true’ climate sensitivity is relatively low?  No.  The absence of evidence and incompleteness of our knowledge (e.g. low/medium confidence) does not rule out unforeseen and unforeseeable extreme values of climate sensitivity.
&gt;
&gt;So how are we to interpret our current understanding (and lack of understanding) of climate sensitivity in terms of policy?  Well that will be the topic of a forthcoming post.

"3350","cpyiv1i","2","0","t1_cpxxlxk","Think of it like this. At the air/water interface of a cyclone, the wind is whipping 100+ mph and the waves are crashing some 30m+. This kinetic action mixes the surface and sub surface waters significantly. SST (surface ocean temp) is really just the first few centimeters of water, so really the evaporation rate into a cyclone is dependent on the combination of surface and subsurface, wherein the most violent areas are more dependent on subsurface than surface temperatures. In the case of the current anomaly, which is 150m deep and +6C over normal, the violence of the typhoon will bring that subsurface water into play.

This hypothesis raises a few questions - first, are Typhoons really getting stronger faster? I think that answer is yes and that Maysak is one of the storms that proves it.

A bigger question regarding climate science, how did that subsurface anomaly of +6C get there? I think it has to do with albedo related warming due to the increased meltback we've seen over the last 10 years. The arctic now has 1.4 million km2 less ice during the summer than it used to, and that has proven to cause an additional 4 Wm2 of direct ocean warming in areas that used to have ice. During the summer, that's an additional 56 Terawatts of power absorbed in the arctic waters. There's really nowhere for this energy to go except into the ocean currents. By the time the thermohaline circulation reaches the equator, this energy is in the subsurface bands which we now see as warm anomalies. 

Now, the kinetic power of a Cat1 typhoon is about 1 Terawatt, and a Cat5 might be 10 Terawatts (depends on a lot of factors, not just windspeed). When the warm water mixes and evaporates into the typhoon, we're witnessing a conversion of thermal energy to kinetic energy. At that point, the global warming energy is transferred into the atmosphere, where it remains until the storm disentigrates (usually on land).

Last year (October), Typhoon Nuri increased from a Cat1 to a Cat5 in 1 day!! But, unlike Maysak, Nuri went due north delivering record low pressures to the Aluetian islands, and subsequently (IMO) had enough power to move the polar jet stream and put the big bend in it - like a gigantic pipe bender. Once it was bent, it stayed there -- and it's still there -- making the polar vortex, record snow in Boston, drought in California, warm wet Alaskan winter...what goes around comes around.

"3359","cpytca6","-1","0","t1_cpxhccx","&gt;Your articles do not state how much the deserts so you cannot make the claim that desertification is insignificant.

The great deserts are shrinking. That's what I said and that's what the data says. I'm talking about what the data reflects. Local dersertification is primarily a land use issue. 

&gt;It's based off of climate models, and is common knowledge (an argument that you have used before so don't nit pick)

Models are not data. When the model is not reflected in the data then the model must be wrong.

&gt;1.4 billion people is not a ""local area"" as they depend on the glaicers of the himilayas to moderate the flow of rivers originating out of them, especially in the drier seasons. Don't forget that glaciers feed the main rivers used for irrigation in Pallisers triangle, which is a very dry region of the canadian prairies that produces most of Canada's grains.

That's 1.4 billion that have massed due a favourable regime and who have over-extended the resource. Malthus provides a good description of that. We have no hard data as to the the behaviour of those glaciers in the short term much less over changing climate regime. So there is no way to know if what we're seeing is the least bit unusual.

I live in western Canada. Glaciers have nothing to do with our water supply. The triangle produces very little grain. The big producers are Manitoba and Saskatchewan. 

&gt;No it has not increased vegetation all around the world, a very good example of this is looking at B.C, norther alberta and Alaska, all showed a drop in photosynthesis, and SE asia showed no change to a drop in photosynthesis rates as well.

I don't buy that. Besides, you're still arguing local conditions while I'm talking global.

&gt;Please provide a source for this claim.

Excuse me? AGW, and by extension you, is making the claim for warming and pH so that's where we lay the burden of proof. There's no data to back the model so once again the model is wrong.

&gt;Source please because corral bleaching is happening all around the world. As you can see coral bleaching occurs from warmer sea temperatures and acidification. Also warming sea temperatures changes the microbiota of the coral colony. 

Take a good look at where that bleaching is happening:

1) equatorial areas - where global temps have risen the least. We all know that this current warming period has affected the higher latitudes while the equator has shown little or no increase. 

2) Heavy human population in the area with run-off and ocean dumping.

&gt;You do realize that humans have been tracking animal migrations for centuries right? Hunters need to know migration patterns of their prey, fur traders need to seasonality ranges of the animals they are trapping, and nomadic cultures know the seasonal movements of their prey. It is not as tracking the ranges of species is a new field of study, so we can compare the movements of species to past observations. 

Show me their data sets. You people keep on arguing that ""anecdotal evidence"" is not allowed, until you don't have a data-set to back you up. Then such lack of data is no longer an issue.

"3372","cpzka34","1","0","t1_cpz9m0l","People think they need a citation for everything when really all they need is a calculator, some basic facts that can be googled in 2 seconds, and a brain. There are 100 different ways to do this calculation. So, here's one of the ways done by a friend who is really good with facts and calculators: 

1) Standard CO2 level is 285ppm. Today we are at 400 ppmv. That is an excess of 115 ppmv.
2) The atmosphere is 78% N2, 21% O2, 0.93% Ar, and 0.04% CO2 approximately, leaving 0.03% other - by volume. The mass of the atmosphere is 5.15 e18 Kg. 
3) The atomic weight of N2 is 28, O2 is 32, Ar is 40, and CO2 is 44. The fractional weight of CO2 is then: 0.04x44/(0.04x44+28x79+32*21+40*0.93) = 6.02e-4, or 0.0602%.
4) The atmospheric mass of CO2 is then 6.02e-4 x 5.15e18 = 3.1e15 Kg.
5) According to the IPCC, CO2 is now causing 1.68 W/msq of forcing. The surface area of the earth is 509 e6 square Km. 
6) A gallon of gasoline creates 19.6 pounds (8.91kg) of CO2. 
So the total power of one gallon of gas is: 8.91 / 3.1e15 x 1.68 x 509e6 x 1e6 (msq/kmsq) = 2.44 watts. 
6) A gallon of gas has a heat energy of 33.7 KWH. So it would take the co2 of one gallon 33.7x3.6e6/2.44 seconds to produce the same heat, or 575 days. 
7) But, we need to correct for the excess: 115ppmv vs. 400ppmv, bring it down to 165 days.
8) But we need to also correct for the CO2 that gets absorbed into the ocean and land. About 46% remains in the atmosphere. That bumps the time to 360 days.

So, here my friend estimates, based on this set of facts, that it will take 1 year for gasoline to trap the same amount of energy via global warming that the gasoline produced when it was burned.

As I said in the intro - you can choose your own facts and do your own calculations. If you want citations for each of the facts - like how many pounds of CO2 a gallon of gas makes, then I suggest you cut and paste each fact into google to verify whether it's right or wrong. Or, come up with your own set of facts and your own calculation and see what you get. Using a completely different set of facts and doing the calculation in my head for coal, I got about half that time. Another time, I did essentially the same calculation based on the amount of cow manure that an Indian family burns to cook their food, combined with the kerosene that was used to sinter the bricks that made their house, to extrapolate whether we'd all be better off living like Indians without electricity (the answer is not a lot better because their population density is so high).

I asked you how much are they shrinking? Is it even an amount that should be considered statistically valid? Also saying that local desertification in areas where this greening has happened indicates that we still cannot use this land for agriculture.

&gt;Models are not data. When the model is not reflected in the data then the model must be wrong.

You do realize that in every scientific discipline models are not used to give exact predictions, right? They are used to project trends, of what could happen given that data, and inputs that we have. No scientist, or any person with any sort of scientific background believes that models are some sort of crystal ball that lets us predict the future with 100% accuracy.

&gt;We have no hard data as to the the behaviour of those glaciers in the short term much less over changing climate regime.

Yes we do. Read the paper I provided you, It clearly states that the Himalayan glaciers help keep the discharges up of out flowing rivers in the drier seasons.

&gt;So there is no way to know if what we're seeing is the least bit unusual.

What do you mean unusual? We know for a fact that glaciers help feed the rivers during the drier season. I don't know where you are getting confused here.

&gt;I live in western Canada. Glaciers have nothing to do with our water supply. The triangle produces very little grain. The big producers are Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

I also live in western Canada, and it is apparent you do not have any knowledge in the watersheds of western Canada, or the geography of western Canada for that matter. As I provided you with a a paper that stated that over 20% of the flow from the bow river that reaches Calgary in during the late summer is directly attributed to glaciers, and over 30% of the water that reaches Edmonton in from the North Saskatchewan river is attributed to glacial melt. I do not know what grounds you are try to fight this paper on because you are not supporting your claims with any data. 

Also stating that the palisers triangle produces little to know grain, and then stating that Saskatchewan produces a lot of grain is hilarious. You do realize that the vast majority of southern Saskatchewan is palisers triangle, right? [Here](http://uregina.ca/~sauchyn/urdendro/afiffig1.gif) is a map of it just in case you forgot where the triangle is located. Oh and just little tid bit of information for you the provinces that produce the most wheat goes Saskatchewan, Alberta, THEN Manitoba according to [this](http://www5.agr.gc.ca/resources/prod/doc/misb/mag-gam/mor-rmar/img/rmar_v02n06_01_eng.gif), and [this](http://option.canada.pagesperso-orange.fr/images/Iconographie%20Canada/graph_wheat.gif).

&gt;Excuse me? AGW, and by extension you, is making the claim for warming and pH so that's where we lay the burden of proof. There's no data to back the model so once again the model is wrong.

What are you talking about? You said the oceans aren't warming and the pH is clearly not dropping. It clearly is [warming](http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/images/indicator_figures/sea-surface-temp-figure1-2014.png), and the [pH](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/WOA05_GLODAP_del_pH_AYool.png) has lowered from 8.25-to 8.14. and since as you may know, pH operates on a logarithmic scale that means the concentration of H+ in the oceans has increased 30%. So as you can see, again your statements have no data backing them up, which is really weird as to why you are still trying fight with data.

&gt;1) equatorial areas - where global temps have risen the least. We all know that this current warming period has affected the higher latitudes while the equator has shown little or no increase.

Do you know why there is more bleaching in tropical areas? It is because the vast majority of coral is found in tropical areas. But in case you forgot, I gave you a map earlier that showed all the bleaching that happened in the world, and there was bleaching in more mid latitude areas.  

&gt;2) Heavy human population in the area with run-off and ocean dumping.

Yes but as I have already shown you earlier, higher ocean temperatures and a more acidic ocean, makes coral more susceptible to pollution, and disease.

&gt;Show me their data sets.

Well [here](http://www.ualberta.ca/~gyates/pictures/Hudson_Bay_Cycle-Sinauer_Assoc_Inc_www.mie.utoronto.ca.jpg) is a classic one of how the Hudson bay company had tracked the populations of lynx and hare, showing that yes in the 1800's biologists had been keeping track of animal populations. Really if you want to, look up the historical populations of almost any animal in North America, or Europe and you would be amazed. 

&gt;You people keep on arguing that ""anecdotal evidence"" is not allowed, until you don't have a data-set to back you up.

No, no ,no. anecdotal evidence that is only observed over one season, and cannot be easily observed again and again. Is bad anecdotal evidence. But if a native group says the over decades, grizzly bear populations have started to move north and many other villages/settlements have also noticed that grizzly bear populations have started to venture more northward. Then that is acceptable anecdotal evidences     

&gt;you're bringing up off-topic red-herrings.

In no way have I used a tactic to try and distract you.

&gt;We're not talking about traditional knowledge, we're talking about the fine measures needed to back climate claims.

Except you can use traditional knowledge as a basis to use as estimates, to compare to your observed data right now, when it comes to changes in home ranges of species fine tuned measurements aren't always necessary. You would know this if you had ever taken any courses, or work that involved ecological systems.

I disagree with that assertion. The Environmental movement has very often brought attention to *real* issues, be it lead in gasoline, ozone layer depletion, acid rain, etc.

In each of these cases, there were lots of people claiming the environmentalists were overstating things, but in the end these turned out to be significant issues that had to be dealt with.

You're obviously talking about nuclear (even though NG is a *lower* carbon alternative*). It's inaccurate to claim that the environmental movement is alone in opposing nuclear; in reality, there are lots of NIMBYs on both sides of the aisle. Nuclear is simply a hard sell, and it's unlikely we would be able to produce enough nuclear plants (and in the needed time frame) in order to solve the issue.

The only way forward, IMO, is by using an ""all of the above"" strategy, including Natural Gas as a stopgap measure while more renewables are deployed.

I know we don't see eye to eye on this, but as much as I'd like to see a bigger push for next-gen nuclear reactors and heavy investment in fusion research, I just don't see it politically.

&gt; If Dr. Stevens doesn't thin Lewis is using his results appropriately, it is his duty as a scientist to lay out a logical argument as to why Lewis is wrong.

he did, and i even provided you a link to where he lays out the logical argument (his presentation slides from Ringberg). the Otto/Lewis method is at its heart a model-derived estimate of ECS. it uses observational data as input to the model but fundamentally, it characterizes the ECS of a simplified energy balance model. many people have written and given presentations at various conferences why this approach is very problematic - in particular it doesn't satisfactorily model multi-timescale feedbacks, of which the ocean is most important. thus the result from Otto/Lewis *has* to be biased low.

You can throw whatever inputs you want into the Otto/Lewis model/technique. it doesnt make the answer you get right. Garbage in, garbage out. actually, the same could be said about Stevens paper because it does not adequately model asymmetric hemispheric differences in aerosol forcing and assuredly is biased low. Garbage in, garbage out. But useful garbage.

In fact other people recently used a [similar technique](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2573.html) and derived a much higher value of ECS. what does that say about the robustness of the method if simply changing out the EBM underlying the calculation doubles your answer? can't take *any* of these types of results seriously until the methodology is re-evaluated and fixed in light of the fact that it produces non-robust and sometimes unphysical results. unphysical as judged by the rest of the body of evidence which is the next point - 

&gt; ECS and TCR are not a closed subject because of one paper, or even a handful of them.

On this you are right and this is the problem when you state that the ""best estimate lie between 2.5-3.0"" is wrong. That's the survey from *all the literature*. The Otto/Lewis method is an outlier with, at this point, known biases. its best to go with what all the literature says and not cherry pick outlier results. Much of that literature is based on observational and physical evidence (stevens even outlines the physical arguments why ECS really can't be below 2.0 in the linked slides from previous comment) ""Considering all the literature"" is an *inclusive* process. it doesn't mean you reject all the literature at odds with Otto/Lewis - of which there is legion.

In one of the commentary's a factor in my friends calculation was said to be wrong. Instead of 1,000, the commentator said it should be 5-200, which I disagreed and pointed out why. But even if you use 5, it still comes out that each kwh of usable energy produces 5 kwh of global warming - even that doesn't seem like a good trade-off if you believe that we should transition away from fossil fuel. I think once people realize, by simple math, how truely devastating burning 35 billion tons of fossil fuel per year is to the trajectory of the climate, then it is not something they should just let happen. By doing your own calculation, you come to the conclusion yourself without having somebody else try to tell you the answer.

[They don't actually know there will be harm]
on this point, purely from the loss of specie standpoint, and in particular the polar bear and the 35,000 walruses (whom I represent), there very clearly has been harm (we can't get to our food anymore - becasue there isn't any more ice). Now, it may not have harmed you personally; however, your grandchildren's life experience is compromised and diminished.

[environmental movement]
My observation is that there is a generalized awareness that there is a real problem recognized by the vast majority of the scientific community. Some of them are screaming because they have calculated the long term result, which if you do the simple calculation yourself, you will find it is undeniable. But rather than having the courage to accept the fact, many in the general population retreat to a sheltered psychosis that recommends no action. No action is always easier than action, even though IMO it is cowardly behavior for the well informed.

[Those of us who would really like to see a transition]...are blaming the messenger for their inaction? Clearly there are solutions that work ,and are taking off at exponential rates - basically as fast as banks can finance them (solar, wind) - that's already been decided. My concern moving forward is that it hasn't fixed the problem because with the loss of the ice on the north pole we have tipped the balance and the warming problem will accelerate even without adding more CO2. Did you know that the ice loss in the last 10 years (1.4 million km2) already causes 56 Terawatts of additional ocean heating each summer - in addition to the CO2? Once all of of the ice melts, that number jumps to, i dunno, 200 Terawatts. These things are easy to calculate. High school students can do it. You don't need a PhD.

These days we calculate the global mean temperature anomaly by taking temperature measurements (by satellites and other methods) from different places all around the world every day... then we compare the temperatures for each location against a base year to determine if it's hotter or colder. One place might hotter by 2 degrees, another place might be colder by 2 degrees, etc. Then we average all that to come up with a single number for global mean temperature anomaly. 

So how are we going to have data from 1850 that we know is accurate to within fractions of a degree? The technology didn't exist back then to get accurate measurements from locations all around the globe. Sure, we could measure temperature back then... but was everything accurate to within fractions of a degree?  If it turns out that the data is off by just 1 degree, then that would mean that it's no warmer now than it was in 1850 before we started really pumping the CO2 into the atmosphere. The point is, we don't really know. We're estimating that it was .85 degrees cooler overall back then...but truthfully, we don't know that with any reasonable degree of certainty.

It's admitted that the temperature record prior to 1850 is not accurate to within fractions of a degree. They use proxies to try to reconstruct things, but we don't have accurate numbers for anything prior to 1850. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the medieval warm period was hotter than it was today... though we can't know for sure.

But for the measurements in the late 1800s... it was basically just measuring surface temperatures with thermometers... but how accurate were thermometers back then?

But this is from the wikipedia page about how they calculated temperature in the late 1880s:

----------------

Deriving a reliable global temperature from the instrument data is not easy because the instruments are not evenly distributed across the planet, the hardware and observing locations have changed over the years, and there has been extensive land use change (such as urbanization) around some of the sites.

The calculation needs to filter out the changes that have occurred over time that are not climate related (e.g. urban heat islands), then interpolate across regions where instrument data has historically been sparse (e.g. in the southern hemisphere and at sea), before an average can be taken.


---------------------

No, you linked to a slideshow he produced before Nic Lewis recalculated his numbers.  Lewis gets a single mention in the slideshow, and it regarded his lower work.

The two researchers are taking very different approaches to the ECS question.  Stevens is basing his feedback calculations on GCMs.  (""My feedback parameters are the summary of approx 90 CMIP3 and CMIP5 estimates in the literature."")  Lewis is using straight observational data and simply climate models.  Feedbacks in GCMs are problematic because they don't know how to model clouds very well, as the modellers themselves have admitted forthrightly.

&gt;the Otto/Lewis method is at its heart a model-derived estimate of ECS.

Yes, a simple model.  As I pointed out above, Stevens is relying on a cohort of general circulation models.  No one is estimating ECS or TCR in climate science without some sort of model, so I'm not sure what your point is.

&gt;Garbage in, garbage out.

True of Stevens as well, and anyone else.  I'm not seeing a critique of Lewis's actual work here.

&gt;In fact other people recently used a similar technique and derived a much higher value of ECS. 

That paper suggests a lower ECS than previous IPCC assessment reports!  AR4 said 3.0 was the most likely value.  AR5 didn't state a most likely value.  This paper says 2.5-2.8°C.  I see no evidence that it uses Lewis's technique at all.

&gt;On this you are right and this is the problem when you state that the ""best estimate lie between 2.5-3.0"" is wrong. 

Not at all.  When different papers produce different best estimates, we can't yet say that a single half-degree range is the universal best estimate.  The best estimate for a single paper, using the methodologies of the researcher of that paper, might be a certain narrow range, but you seem to be saying we have a universally accepted most likely range, and that's simply wrong.  Perhaps I misunderstood you.  If so, I apologize.

&gt;The Otto/Lewis method is an outlier...

Not at all.

“Climate Sensitivity Estimated from Temperature Reconstructions of the Last Glacial Maximum,” by Andreas Schmittner et al, 2011:

&gt;&gt;Here, combining extensive sea and land surface temperature reconstructions from the Last Glacial Maximum with climate model simulations, we estimate a lower median (2.3 K) and reduced uncertainty (1.7–2.6 K 66% probability). Assuming paleoclimatic constraints apply to the future as predicted by our model, these results imply lower probability of imminent extreme climatic change than previously thought.

From “Bayesian estimation of climate sensitivity based on a simple climate model fitted to observations of hemispheric temperatures and global ocean heat content,” by Magne Aldrin et al., 2012:

&gt;&gt;The [climate sensitivity] mean is 2.0°C… which is lower than the IPCC estimate from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC, 2007), but this estimate increases if an extra forcing component is added, see the following text. The 95% credible interval (CI) ranges from 1.1°C to 4.3°C, whereas the 90% CI ranges from 1.2°C to 3.5°C.

From “Improved constraints on 21st-century warming derived using 160 years of temperature observations,” by Nathan Gillett et al., 2012:

&gt;&gt;Our analysis also leads to a relatively low and tightly-constrained estimate of Transient Climate Response of 1.3–1.8°C, and relatively low projections of 21st-century warming… which is towards the lower end of the observationally constrained range assessed by [the IPCC AR4].

From ""A lower and more constrained estimate of climate sensitivity using updated observations and detailed radiative forcing time series"" by Skeie, et al, 2013:

&gt;&gt;The posterior mean of the ECS is 1.8 ◦C, with 90 % C.I. ranging from 0.9 to 3.2 ◦C, which is tighter than most previously published
estimates.

From the first Earth Day in 1970:

1. Harvard biologist George Wald estimated that “civilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken against problems facing mankind.”

2. “We are in an environmental crisis which threatens the survival of this nation, and of the world as a suitable place of human habitation,” wrote Washington University biologist Barry Commoner in the Earth Day issue of the scholarly journal Environment.

3. The day after the first Earth Day, the New York Times editorial page warned, “Man must stop pollution and conserve his resources, not merely to enhance existence but to save the race from intolerable deterioration and possible extinction.”

4. “Population will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in food supplies we make,” Paul Ehrlich confidently declared in the April 1970 Mademoiselle. “The death rate will increase until at least 100-200 million people per year will be starving to death during the next ten years.”

5. “Most of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man have already been born,” wrote Paul Ehrlich in a 1969 essay titled “Eco-Catastrophe! “By…[1975] some experts feel that food shortages will have escalated the present level of world hunger and starvation into famines of unbelievable proportions. Other experts, more optimistic, think the ultimate food-population collision will not occur until the decade of the 1980s.”

6. Ehrlich sketched out his most alarmist scenario for the 1970 Earth Day issue of The Progressive, assuring readers that between 1980 and 1989, some 4 billion people, including 65 million Americans, would perish in the “Great Die-Off.”

7. “It is already too late to avoid mass starvation,” declared Denis Hayes, the chief organizer for Earth Day, in the Spring 1970 issue of The Living Wilderness.

8. Peter Gunter, a North Texas State University professor, wrote in 1970, “Demographers agree almost unanimously on the following grim timetable: by 1975 widespread famines will begin in India; these will spread by 1990 to include all of India, Pakistan, China and the Near East, Africa. By the year 2000, or conceivably sooner, South and Central America will exist under famine conditions….By the year 2000, thirty years from now, the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America, and Australia, will be in famine.”

9. In January 1970, Life reported, “Scientists have solid experimental and theoretical evidence to support…the following predictions: In a decade, urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution…by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half….”

10. Ecologist Kenneth Watt told Time that, “At the present rate of nitrogen buildup, it’s only a matter of time before light will be filtered out of the atmosphere and none of our land will be usable.”

11. Barry Commoner predicted that decaying organic pollutants would use up all of the oxygen in America’s rivers, causing freshwater fish to suffocate.

12. Paul Ehrlich chimed in, predicting in his 1970 that “air pollution…is certainly going to take hundreds of thousands of lives in the next few years alone.” Ehrlich sketched a scenario in which 200,000 Americans would die in 1973 during “smog disasters” in New York and Los Angeles.

13. Paul Ehrlich warned in the May 1970 issue of Audubon that DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbons “may have substantially reduced the life expectancy of people born since 1945.” Ehrlich warned that Americans born since 1946…now had a life expectancy of only 49 years, and he predicted that if current patterns continued this expectancy would reach 42 years by 1980, when it might level out.

14. Ecologist Kenneth Watt declared, 'By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate…that there won’t be any more crude oil. You’ll drive up to the pump and say, ""Fill 'er up, buddy,"" and he’ll say, ""I am very sorry, there isn’t any.""'

15. Harrison Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a chart in Scientific American that looked at metal reserves and estimated the humanity would totally run out of copper shortly after 2000. Lead, zinc, tin, gold, and silver would be gone before 1990.

16. Sen. Gaylord Nelson wrote in Look that, “Dr. S. Dillon Ripley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institute, believes that in 25 years, somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.”

17. In 1975, Paul Ehrlich predicted that “since more than nine-tenths of the original tropical rainforests will be removed in most areas within the next 30 years or so, it is expected that half of the organisms in these areas will vanish with it.”

18. Kenneth Watt warned about a pending Ice Age in a speech. “The world has been chilling sharply for about twenty years,” he declared. “If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age.”

That was just **one day**.  The crazy shit extreme environmentalists say didn't exactly end in 1970.

&gt;You're obviously talking about nuclear 

Correct.

&gt;(even though NG is a lower carbon alternative).

Absolutely not.  NG has half the CO2 emissions per unit of energy produced as does coal.

&gt;It's inaccurate to claim that the environmental movement is alone in opposing nuclear.

Nor did I make such a claim.  I said the environmental movement opposes it, but I should be more clear: it's ""Big Green,"" as Jim Hansen calls them, that oppose it.  There's actually a divide within the environmental community over nuclear, with a growing number of environmentalists supporting it.

&gt;Nuclear is simply a hard sell, and it's unlikely we would be able to produce enough nuclear plants (and in the needed time frame) in order to solve the issue.

Nuclear produces more low-carbon energy per dollar spent than any other source.

&gt;I know we don't see eye to eye on this, but as much as I'd like to see a bigger push for next-gen nuclear reactors and heavy investment in fusion research, I just don't see it politically.

Only in Europe and the U.S.  China, India, and Russia are already eclipsing us in advanced nuclear.  Russia is building its *second* active breeder reactor.  India is using thorium in its solid fueled reactors.  The Chinese Academy of Sciences, using technology developed at Oak Ridge, has hired 400 PhDs to work on two thorium variants, one of which is liquid fueled.

But don't think for a second that the general public hasn't picked up on ""Big Green's"" hypocrisy over nuclear power.

For the third time now, I never said it was only Big Green.  The NIMBYs don't give a shit about climate change.  For those who are concerned about climate change, opposition to nuclear power suggests their concern is actually pretty shallow.  *That* is why people don't take them seriously.

You can try to divert blame all you like, but you'll find that most climate skeptics are actually pretty supportive of nuclear power.  To conclude, then I really have run, I urge you to follow Jim Hansen's advice:

&gt;&gt;It is not always easy to speak truth to power, but all citizens have the opportunity if they choose. I have one minor, easy suggestion for you to consider, and another requiring more effort.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The first concerns ""Big Green,"" the large environmental organizations, which have become one of the biggest obstacles to solving the climate problem. After I joined other scientists in requesting the leaders of Big Green to reconsider their adamant opposition to nuclear power, and was rebuffed, I learned from discussions with them the major reason: They feared losing donor support. **Money, it seems, is the language they understand.** Thus my suggestion: **The next time you receive a donation request, doubtless accompanied with a photo of a cuddly bear or the like, toss it in the waste bin and return a note saying that you will consider a donation in the future, if they objectively evaluate the best interests of young people and nature.**

There is a case to be made that recent papers give too much weight to the surface temperature slowdown.

&gt;I cited one of his papers! His conclusion was ECS less than 2.5°C.

That's not in the paper you cited ([Annan and Hargreaves 2011]()), which rather concerns the upper limit for ECS, which it places at around 4C:

&gt;***5 Conclusions***

&gt;*We have investigated the assumptions underlying many recent probabilistic analyses of climate sensitivity, and shown how these may influence policy through a simple
economic analysis of a climate change scenario. We have two main results. First, we have shown that results based on a uniform prior are sensitive to the selection of the
upper bound, and it is surprising that this point has not received more discussion in the literature. We also observe that the uniform priors that have been used represent
extremely pessimistic beliefs about climate sensitivity that cannot truly be considered to represent either “ignorance” or plausible prior beliefs of reasonable scientists.
For these reasons, we consider uniform priors to be a poor choice for this analysis. Second, we have shown that when an analysis is performed based on a reasonable
expert prior, the results are robust with respect to changes in either the details of the choice of prior, or the likelihood function. Even using a Cauchy prior (based on a
rather pessimistic interpretation of the NRC report), which has such extremely long and fat tails that it has no mean or variance, gives quite reasonable results. While
we are reluctant to openly endorse such a pathological choice of prior, we think it should at least be immune from any criticism that it is overly optimistic. When this
prior is updated with the analysis of Forster and Gregory (2006), the long fat tail that is characteristic of all recent estimates of climate sensitivity simply disappears, with
an upper 95% probability limit for S easily shown to lie close to 4◦C, and certainly well below 6◦C. Alternative likelihoods based on Hegerl et al. (2006) and Annan
and Hargreaves (2006) generate similar results. Thus it might be reasonable for the IPCC to upgrade their confidence in S lying below 4.5◦C to the “extremely likely”
level, indicating 95% probability of a lower value. Expected economic losses are also strongly impacted by this reduction in the uncertainty of climate sensitivity.
While the economic analysis presented here ignores a substantial additional source of uncertainty by selecting one specific damage function, the use of reasonable expert
priors results in a substantial lowering of the expected loss to around 2% of global GDP for the simple 2×CO2 scenario used.*

It is true that Annan has been critical of some high sensitivity studies and the IPCC on occasion, but he's also been *very* critical of Lewis' arguments, and doesn't think much of Curry's contribution to the debate. Ultimately, it doesn't matter much what the likeliest value is, given the possible range, we can't take a bet that ECS won't be nearer to either lower or upper limits, IMO. We have to hope for the best, but prepare for the worst IMO - but that's getting into politics, so I'll stop there.

&gt;I think it's pretty widely agreed upon that man made CO2 didn't have much of an impact on temperature until after WWII...

It did have an impact before, but the impact was likely not large enough to dominate the overall global trend. Most scientists agree around 1970 as the point where the anthropogenic global warming signal began to override natural fluctuations - though as the decadal slowdown around the turn of the century shows, natural cycles can still given a step-like shape to the warming trend.

&gt;because that's when we really started releasing a lot more carbon. However, temperatures fell for several decades after WWII even though we were emitting a lot more CO2.

Actually, there was a plateau in CO2 emissions around that time.

http://www.skepticalscience.com/images/co2_temp_1900_2008.gif

It's also false to claim that temperatures fell for several decades. The reality is that there was a flat trend, which can be explained by a combination of a plateau in CO2 emissions and increased aerosols.

OK... here's actual evidence to support my claim. I threw together a little image that I derived from the graph that you provided!

http://oi59.tinypic.com/2cyfeir.jpg

In the bottom left picture, the red line represents the the rise in temperature from about 1907 to about 1945. The yellow bar shows the magnitude of the warming. 

The bottom right picture shows the rise in temperature from the mid 1970s to when the graph ends (around 2010ish). The yellow bar shows the total rise in temperature over that time period.

So I think we both agree that the rise in temperature from 1907 to 1945 was mostly natural... and man made CO2 did not really cause this temperature rise (or maybe was only responsible for a tiny fraction of the rise). Yet... this rise in temperature looks just as significant, if not more significant, then the rise in temperature from the mid 1970s to the present. Depending on which specific time period you use, the temperature rise back then can be greater, equal, or less to the current rise... but it's really hard to make the claim that the two warming periods are significantly different.

So when everyone points to the warming that occurred between the mid 1970s and today... it's very fair to say that we saw comparable warming in a similar time frame in the first half of the 20th century that we know was not primarily caused by human produced CO2.

And again, this is your smoothed out graph... if we use data that is not manipulated, it is even more clear that the rise in temperature from the mid 1970s is not unprecedented in earth's recent history.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_31cmoh",1428165371,2015-04-04 16:36:11,"JimmyBall"

Well, we don't need to have a ""complete"" understanding of the mechanics behind the climate to know that human activity is causing a multi-decadal warming trend. There is also no indication we have significantly underestimated natural variation, which is *trend neutral* and thus cannot explain the multi-decadal warming trend.

Finally, we can't say it hasn't been warming as fast as was predicted, because you can't use decadal time frames to determine this.

Also, other datasets, which are just as accurate as RSS, show actual warming over this time period.

Here are actual quotes from the RSS blog:

&gt;*The denialists really like to fit trends starting in 1997, so that the huge 1997-98 ENSO event is at the start of their time series, resulting in a linear fit with the smallest possible slope.*

&gt;*[...]*

&gt;*Does this slow-down in the warming mean that the idea of anthropogenic global warming is no longer valid?  The short answer is ‘no’.  The denialists like to assume that the cause for the model/observation discrepancy is some kind of problem with the fundamental model physics, and they pooh-pooh any other sort of explanation.  This leads them to conclude, very likely erroneously, that the long-term sensitivity of the climate is much less than is currently thought.*

&gt;*[...]*

&gt;*My view is that the subduction of heat into the ocean is very likely a significant part of the explanation for the model/observation discrepancies.  What is less clear is whether or not this subduction is due to random fluctuations in the climate, or some sort of response to anthropogenic forcing.  An important question is now ‘how long will the enhanced trade winds continue?’.  The trade wind anomaly lessened during 2013, but we do not know whether this change will persist over the next few years and lead a positive phase of the IPO, or if the IPO will take longer to flip to its other phase.*

&gt;*I’ll conclude by reiterating that I do not expect that the hiatus and model/observation discrepancies are due to a single cause.  It is far more likely that they are caused by a combination of factors.  Publications, blog posts and media stories that try to pin all the blame on one factor should be viewed with some level of suspicion, whether they are written by climate scientists, journalists, or climate change denialists.*

It isn't.

&gt;So I think we both agree that the rise in temperature from 1907 to 1945 was mostly natural... and man made CO2 did not really cause this temperature rise (or maybe was only responsible for a tiny fraction of the rise)

No, we *don't* both agree. Anthropogenic CO2 could still be responsible for a *signficant* portion of the warming. Just because it isn't the dominant one doesn't mean it's a ""tiny fraction"".

There is also a lag between CO2 concentration and the full effect of that additional atmospheric GHG on temperatures.

&gt;Yet... this rise in temperature looks just as significant, if not more significant, then the rise in temperature from the mid 1970s to the present.

It's actually slightly less steep:

http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/mean:12/plot/gistemp/from:1907/to:1945/trend/plot/gistemp/from:1970/trend

Again, human produced CO2 *did* have an impact back then as well.

If we look at this other graph, we can see that the CO2 warming signal has indeed become stronger, while comparing other climate forcings. This pretty much destroys your argument:

http://www.skepticalscience.com/images/forcings.gif

Finally, when you redo the first graph but using *all* forcings instead of just CO2, you get every good correlation:

It's not a problem. We have actual empirical evidence that most of the 20th century warming is due to the increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gases.

&gt;You're essentially saying that the entire temperature record post 1900 is influenced by CO2...

Actually, climate is *always* influenced by CO2. CO2 is an important climate feedback during natural climate cycles (such as the glaciation-deglaciation cycle of the current Ice Age).

&gt;but how do we know that something abnormal is happening if we can't compare it to ""normal"" time periods?

Well, we can, because we have tons of proxies. We also know CO2 is causing the current multi-decadal warming trend due to other pieces of evidence (such as satellite measurements of outgoing longwave radiation, the fact that nights are warming up faster than days, etc.)

&gt;What record do you think is accurate for the time period prior to 1850. 

There are various proxy reconstructions.

&gt;You keep saying that we have accurate graphs and records...

I've said this for the temperature record. Of course, proxy reconstructions are not as accurate.

&gt; You gonna post Mann's hockey-stick graph? You think that one is accurate?

The graph has been pretty much validated by many other studies, including Pages-2k. Even after taking the corrections of McIntyre and McKitrick in consideration is *still* looks like a hockey stick graph.

In any case, you seem to think people imagined global warming after looking at graphs. In reality, man-made global warming was predicted *decades* before any of the warming became obvious (back in 1896, to be precise).

"3490","cq1zfpl","2","0","t1_cq0z685","&gt; No, you linked to a slideshow he produced before Nic Lewis recalculated his numbers. Lewis gets a single mention in the slideshow, and it regarded his lower work.

How do you know it was written before Lewis recalculated his numbers? He gave the presentation at a conference where Lewis was also a presenter. do you think hes not familiar with the Otto/Lewis technique? Given there was about a week between Lewis posting his result and the Ringberg conference and that Stevens was familiar enough with the result that he explicitly authored a note to disregard that result, *and* that scientists are notorious for throwing together presentations the day before they give them, it's a safe bet that he was aware of Lewis' result before finalizing those slides. which again he gave at a scientific meeting where lewis was in the audience.

&gt; The two researchers are taking very different approaches to the ECS question.

there are a lot more than two researchers tackling ECS. you seem to insist that one of them - Lewis - is 'better' than the others, or at least his method is. you havent explained why, which is really important in light of the fact that his answer disagrees with many others'.

&gt;  As I pointed out above, Stevens is relying on a cohort of general circulation models.

Wrong; Stevens relied on basic physical arguments and observations. Look at his slides again. Dessler, though, heavily leaned on CMIP5 data. But why should you prefer a simple EBM - which misses dynamically-relevent physics to determining ECS - to a GCM?

&gt;  I'm not seeing a critique of Lewis's actual work here.

I already gave you the one-line critique which is the fundamental issue in Lewis' work, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/312bx2/does_a_new_study_from_the_max_planck_institute/cq05zls): ""Otto/Lewis method is wrong, biased too low due to unphysical ocean response in their energy balance model."" please comment on that instead of ignoring the point. correctly modeling heat sequestration from the shallow-&gt;deep ocean is critical for constraining ECS, and their EBM simplifies this away.

&gt; That paper suggests a lower ECS than previous IPCC assessment reports! 

AR5 does not give a ""mean"" or ""best estimate"" ECS anymore. It gives a range. The new Nature paper produces a range itself that is exactly inside the AR5 range. alsio insid the ar4 range. also inside the charney report range (1970). also please don't pretend it doesn't use Lewis' technique, which is a simple hierarchical Bayesian inference using an EBM 'updated' with real-world observations. it's an *identical* approach mathematically, even if the mechanics of the particular bayesian inference differ slightly.

&gt; When different papers produce different best estimates, we can't yet say that a single half-degree range is the universal best estimate.

The global best estimate should be derived from *all* the papers different best estimates. you get at the global estimate by comparing the different results and understanding where the might be biased. GCM-based measurements are biased high because they cannot rule out the fat tail. Paleo-climate inferences are inherently broad so you can't really back out a mode or mean from them, but they can help constrain the range necessary to physical explain historic climate observations. instrumental observation-based estimates are certainly biased low because they use too-simple EBMs and they fail to captuyre the full climate 'response' in the data they use for their inference technique. [Even a co-author of the original Otto paper thinks the technique has this flaw](http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/04/climate-sensitivity-is-unlikely-to-be-less-than-2c-say-scientists/?utm_source=Daily+Carbon+Briefing&amp;utm_campaign=83d4e413c0-cb_daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_876aab4fd7-83d4e413c0-303429069) - ""*Some of the studies cited as evidence for lowering the lower bound on climate sensitivity in the last IPCC report (for example, Otto et al, on which I was a co-author), used models that were arguably too simple - but it is the job of the IPCC to reflect the literature available at the time and to be cautious in ruling out eventualities on the basis of any single line of evidence*"" You combine all this information and figure out what the best estimate is. 

thats what Stevens did. its fine that you prefer a particular technique. but you shouldnt pretend its infallible and 'right' especially when it disagrees so sharply with other constraints. at this point, its still an outlier, and we have a good understanding of why its an outlier.

---

It's nice that you maintain a list of ECS papers. so do plenty of the rest of us, especially people who study this problem. why do you think the climate science community - which is just as familiar as this literature as you are - still thinks ECS is above 2.0 and probably around 3.0? 

because they look at **all** the papers, not the handful you cherry-picked which derive lower mean values, but *also and more importantly ranges entirely consistent with other lines of evidence*. Also, do not confuse TCR and ECS (as in your quote from Gillett et al, 2012). Your Schmittner result is based on GCM's, we can exclude, it right (too bad since it's in virtual agreement with AR5 range). So is Aldrin et al (unless you're going to suggest the mean value of their CI is in the lower half of it, which the paper would *strongly* disagree about)  

you should make a giant table of all the papers, their 90% CI, and their mean estimate where available. Then look at all of them together. Use independent physical reasoning to constrain them and piece them together.

do that, and if you *still* think ECS is less than 2.0 then you should write a paper on it. but if the only reason you think that is because a handful of studies include values that low in their CI, you do not have a compelling argument.

&gt; Every researcher has biases. I don't care what their biases are, only what their science says.

They're apparently shrinking at a rate noticable to satelitte imaging as it says in the linked articles. Andf, they're behaving opposite to prediction. But that isn't part of the answer to the OP which has to do with benefits of AGW. As the articles state CO2 fertalization has had a positive effect. It will be a long while until any such reclaimed land is suitable for agriculture, but in the meantime it's fertile ground for many species.

&gt;You do realize that in every scientific discipline models are not used to give exact predictions, right? They are used to project trends, of what could happen given that data, and inputs that we have. No scientist, or any person with any sort of scientific background believes that models are some sort of crystal ball that lets us predict the future with 100% accuracy.

That's utter garbage. The purpose of models is to explain and predict. I don't know who's filling your head with garbage but that person needs a slap. We have models which describe and predict electrical, chemical, biological, and all manners of physical phenomena. The only field in which failed models are promoted as fact is the new climatology. And, if you didn't know about the prevailance of models as exact predictors then I have to question what you were doing in school. 

&gt;Yes we do. Read the paper I provided you, It clearly states that the Himalayan glaciers help keep the discharges up of out flowing rivers in the drier seasons.

&gt;What do you mean unusual? We know for a fact that glaciers help feed the rivers during the drier season. I don't know where you are getting confused here.

That has nothing to do with what I wrote. What the glaciers do at present is not at issue. The issue is that we have no hard data as to what those glaciers did in the past. Therefore we can't say that what they're doing at present is unusual.

Rivers in southern Alberta are not fed primarily by glaciers. They're fed by mountain snowpack. Glaciers may play a small role, but that's it. Why are you now bringing up Edmonton in a discussion of dry regions?

I'll stand corrected on wheat production, but Saskatchewan is still way out in front. [This map](http://www.grainscanada.gc.ca/wheat-ble/harvest-recolte/2010/hqww10-qrbo10-2a-eng.htm) shows that the bulk of grain production in Alberta is not in the triangle anyway.

Scroll to the bottom of [this page](http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/archive.html?year=2009&amp;month=02) and see that SSTs have followed ENSO activity exactly. The link you provided shows that SSTs are no longer trending upward. The fact is that since the end of the LIA global average temps have risen, as we expect they would, and that would be reflected in SSTs. AGW predicts a continued increase but that is not the case.  The link you provided for pH shows us nothing other than to back what I said about natural variability. You've shown me no data whatsoever on pH, so there's nothing to fight.

&gt;Do you know why there is more bleaching in tropical areas? It is because the vast majority of coral is found in tropical areas. But in case you forgot, I gave you a map earlier that showed all the bleaching that happened in the world, and there was bleaching in more mid latitude areas. 

All of those areas are heavily populated. Temperatures in those areas have not risen so trying to blame bleaching on temperature is ridiculous. It's as if you people have decided that Earth has only one problem and that's CO2. Never mind pollution or overpopulation, those are apparently myths to AGW believers. Bleaching correlates strongly with pollution and not at all with temperature.

&gt;Well here is a classic one of how the Hudson bay company had tracked the populations of lynx and hare, showing that yes in the 1800's biologists had been keeping track of animal populations. Really if you want to, look up the historical populations of almost any animal in North America, or Europe and you would be amazed. 

Why do you think that specifics belie the general case? I wrote this:  ""We're not talking about traditional knowledge, we're talking about **the fine measures needed to back climate claims.**"" What does a Hudson's Bay graph have to do with fine measures?

&gt;No, no ,no. anecdotal evidence that is only observed over one season, and cannot be easily observed again and again. Is bad anecdotal evidence. But if a native group says the over decades, grizzly bear populations have started to move north and many other villages/settlements have also noticed that grizzly bear populations have started to venture more northward. Then that is acceptable anecdotal evidences 

On that we can agree. Hard data is scarce while soft data is plentiful. It's such soft data that tells us of natural variability. One of the first arguments raised against AGW was the natural varibility of climate on century time-scales. That. of course, was rejected by the new climatology (see M Mann) that insisted that global temperatures had been stable for thousands of years. A lack of hard data was enough to reject the wisdom of generations. We now have such hard data and AGW can't fit that into the new theory, other than to insist that the current *rate* of warming is unprecedented. And for that they have no hard data, only speculation. And since that comes from ""real"" climate scientists and not ""anecdotal fools"" we're expected to buy it.

&gt; In no way have I used a tactic to try and distract you.

Considering how off-topic you've gone in this thread that's not really accurate now is it?

The ""fudging"" they do is done very carefully, with an eye to understanding any uncertainty. So the uncertainties are fairly well understood and are well under 1 degree C. In the graphic you linked to, the uncertainties in the older parts of the reconstruction are around +-0.25 degrees C, which is not nothing, but which is small compared with the observed changes. What's more, while that is probably the 95% confidence interval, the probability of being at the extremes is lower than the probability of being in the middle. 

Of course, all this would be much more meaningful if the science of climate change were based on ""we see it warming so we need to find an explanation"". But it's not - it's based on ""all our understanding of basic thermal physics says it should be warming, so let's look at the data and see if it acts as we'd expect it to"". And the answer, of course, is yes. Remember that the first scientist to make the connection between CO2 and global temperature did so in the 1860s, and the first paper suggesting human CO2 emissions  could impact the planet's temperatue was published in 1896 - long before anything observable had taken place. The basic science that says ""increasing CO2 will lead to a higher mean equilibrium temperature"" is extremely robust. The only meaningful questions are about the strengths of various feedbacks, and we're learning more about those all the time.

Man made forces now drive the climate, but it's not driving it in the way one would normally think about driving a car. For example, in the last century man released CFC's into the atmosphere by making millions of leaky air conditioners and it began to destroy the ozone layer of the atmosphere. Fortunately, scientists detected the problem, and activists along with government changed the rules and made CFC's illegal. A few decades later, the CFC's dissapated and that impact on the climate was cured. And its a good thing, because if people hadn't listened and insisted that the government act, the increased UV radiation would likely have destroyed all life on earth (or at least life as we know it). 

Say there there weren't enough activists and the govt hadn't listened and didn't act. Man would probably still be alive, holed up in air conditioned bunkers, growing food with LED lights. What's happening today with global warming is really no different. 70% of the world population believes that we must act immediately to avoid environmental catastrophe. One difference, however, is that giving up fossil fuel is a lot more painful than switching to a more expensive and less effective refrigerant. But the consequences, unfortunately, are likely to be the same.

You see, it does a lot more harm than good to propagate the fallacy that we're not having an impact. We surely are.

Here's a link with the ozone story. Note that the worldwide agreement was passed in 1987, but the ozone hole didn't acutally peak until 2006. Now, imagine what would've happened had we done nothing. Can you imagine that? the ozone hole would've grown to cover the entire southern hemisphere, killing all plants. Am I right, or wrong?

&gt;The __Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer__ (a protocol to the [Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_the_Ozone_Layer)) is an international [treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty) designed to protect the [ozone layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer) by phasing out the production of numerous substances that are responsible for [ozone depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion). It was agreed on September 16, 1987, and entered into force on January 1, 1989, followed by a first meeting in [Helsinki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki), May 1989. Since then, it has undergone eight revisions, in 1990 ([London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London)), 1991 ([Nairobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairobi)), 1992 ([Copenhagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen)), 1993 ([Bangkok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok)), 1995 ([Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna)), 1997 ([Montreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal)), 1999 ([Beijing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing)) and 2007 ([Montreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal)).  As a result of the international agreement, the ozone hole in Antarctica is slowly recovering. Climate projections indicate that the ozone layer will return to 1980 levels between 2050 and 2070.   Due to its widespread adoption and implementation it has been hailed as an example of exceptional international co-operation, with [Kofi Annan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan) quoted as saying that ""perhaps the single most successful international agreement to date has been the Montreal Protocol"".  In comparison, effective burden sharing and solution proposals mitigating regional conflicts of interest have been among the success factors for the [Ozone depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion) challenge, where global regulation based on the [Kyoto Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol) has failed to do so.  In case of the ozone depletion challenge, there was global regulation already being installed before a scientific consensus was established. As well in comparison, lay people and public opinion were more convinced about possible eminent risks.

&gt;The amount of energy represented by this anomaly is equivalent to 4.2 million Terawatt hours of energy

This is incorrect. I did a more rigorous calculation last night, and I came up with the number of 600 Terawatt Hours to describe the +3C difference between this Kelvin wave and the usual ones (keeping the volume numbers the same). That's still a lot of energy, but it's not enough to ""hide"" the AGW. I did another calculation of just the Arctic amplification, assuming that the 1.4 Million km2 of ice loss persists for 1 month in the summer, and I got 4,000 terawatt hours. Seeing as how the arctic amplification is spread across both the Atlantic and Pacific, it seems that most of this extra heat could be provided by the sea ice loss amplification alone. To me this all makes sense and fits with Mr. Scribblers more detailed supercomputer analysis. The Arctic water heats up a lot more than normal, makes its way down the california coast (killing the fish and causing sickness in the sea lions along the way while it sinks), and then re-emerging in the equatorial zone, contributing to the el nino and causing bigger typhoons. By the way, 600 Terawatt hours is enough kinetic energy to create 3 additional Cat5 typhoons. An average typhoon will have about 1 Terawatt of power, and a Cat5 about 5. If I'm right, we'll have more typhoons in the western pacific. Last week we had a record breaker - strongest early typhoon ever in March. I just looked this morning, and 2 more formed in the last 2 days, adding to the record breaker Maysak.

http://www.wunderground.com/hurricane/

When a typhoon forms and spins up, it's converting the thermal energy in the ocean directly into kinetic energy. It's phenomenal to watch these happen nowadays, sometimes growing from Cat1 - Cat5 in just 24 hours. Do you realize that is the same rate of power consumption as the entire US electricity grid?

Now, I have a lot of friends in the Philippines, and they just spent their Easter Sunday defending themselves from a deadly typhoon for the first time in their lives on this holiday - the typhoons are not supposed to come this early, and now their likely to see them stacked up, slamming into the country every couple weeks for the rest of the year. I hate it when people have the audacity and self centeredness to say that it's all BS. It isn't. Climate change is real and it affects people and animals severely every day and it's getting worse.

&gt;Such a ""trend"" is meaningless in itself. Newer papers don't invalidate older ones, especially when methodologies are different.

What we see is a divergence from estimates based on GCMs and simple climate models incorporating recent observations.  The former generally produce high ECS, the latter lower ECS (and TCR).

&gt;There is a case to be made that recent papers give too much weight to the surface temperature slowdown.

I think the slowdown is the nexus of these lower estimates, for sure.  GCMs predicted acceleration of temperatures, observations showed a slowdown.  I think we would be wise to listen to the modellers themselves who say that modelling clouds has been very tricky.

&gt;That's not in the paper you cited...

Hmm.  I had another paper in mind, I guess.  My bad.  Sorry about the mix-up.

&gt;Ultimately, it doesn't matter much what the likeliest value is, given the possible range, we can't take a bet that ECS won't be nearer to either lower or upper limits, IMO. 

On this topic, I think TCR is the most relevant metric for immediate impacts.  There's still a lot of discussion on how long it takes to reach equilibrium.  If, for illustrative purposes, it takes 1,000 years to reach equilibrium, then ECS doesn't matter much.  

I think the reason I find it important to look at the whole picture regarding sensitivity (ECS or TCR) is because there is a real and important discussion to be had about adaptation versus mitigation, and the costs of each approach within those broad categories.
&gt;
We have to hope for the best, but prepare for the worst IMO - but that's getting into politics, so I'll stop there.

&gt;By what ratio?

If we use the (somewhat dated) [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_policy_of_China#Nuclear_power), China will go from 11 GW nuclear capacity in 2012 to 86 GW in 2020.  

According to another [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_China#Wind_power), China's goal for wind is 100 GW capacity in 2020 and 20 GW solar in 2020, up from ~25-30 GW and 8.3 GW in 2012, respectively.

Keeping in mind that the capacity factor for nuclear is higher than 90%, wind is less than 30%, and solar is ~25%, we get effective capacity growth of 67.5 GW for nuclear, 22.5 GW for wind, and 2.9 GW for solar, for a ratio of 2.65:1 for nuclear:(wind + solar).

&gt;All the more reason why ""climate skeptics"" are hampering nuclear development. If it weren't for those claiming AGW is not a big deal, you'd have a lot less NIMBYs as attitudes towards nuclear energy would change.

When NIMBYs who might concerned about climate change listen to Big Green, their NIMBY-ness is magnified.  Given that many climate skeptics are pro-nuclear, I'm not sure you can lay this at their feet.

&gt;I'm saying their arguments against AGW being a threat are delaying the development of nuclear energy.

Lewis just recalculated a couple of weeks ago.

&gt;Given there was about a week between Lewis posting his result and the Ringberg conference and that Stevens was familiar enough with the result that he explicitly authored a note to disregard that result...

Assuming he knew Lewis's result and assuming he 
disregarded it is pure speculation on your part.  He hasn't written anything specifically in response to it.  Drop me a line when he has.

&gt;there are a lot more than two researchers tackling ECS...

Yes. I just cited ten papers from various authors about ECS.  Please don't put words in my mouth.

&gt;Wrong; Stevens relied on basic physical arguments and observations. Look at his slides again.

No, *you* look at his slides again, where he specifically points out that he is using GCM ensembles.  I freakin' quoted the slide where he says so.

&gt;I already gave you the one-line critique which is the fundamental issue in Lewis' work, here: ""Otto/Lewis method is wrong, biased too low due to unphysical ocean response in their energy balance model.""

That's not a critique.  That's him saying, ""wrong.""  This will all bear out in the literature.  You are far too dismissive of this topic before it has even had a chance to be developed.

&gt;AR5 does not give a ""mean"" or ""best estimate"" ECS anymore. It gives a range.

Yes, I know.  A (slightly) lower range than AR4.  The reason for the lowering of the bottom end of the range and the reason for not listing a most likely value?  The authors couldn't agree.  They said that GCMs weren't matching observation well enough to reply on them the way AR4 did.

&gt; instrumental observation-based estimates are certainly biased low because they use too-simple EBMs and they fail to captuyre the full climate 'response' in the data they use for their inference technique.

You can't dismiss so much literature so easily.  The response seems to be less than feared, given the recent slowdown in warming, so you can't simply assume that feedbacks will be high, then dismiss observationally based papers as too low based on your assumption.

&gt;its fine that you prefer a particular technique. 

I prefer techniques that match observations, yes.  If modellers themselves are saying the GCMs exhibit poor skill in modelling clouds, why do you think it's OK to rely on GCM derived estimates?

&gt;why do you think the climate science community - which is just as familiar as this literature as you are - still thinks ECS is above 2.0 and probably around 3.0?

You have yet to demonstrate that there is any such consensus.  The trend in the literature since AR5 (and even before AR5 was published, but after the cut off date for new papers) is lower sensitivity.  Feel free, though, to show any sort of documentation that most people in the climate science community agree on these metrics.

&gt;because they look at all the papers, not the handful you cherry-picked which derive lower mean values

How many papers would you need to not claim I'm cherry picking?  Is there an upper limit?

&gt;Also, do not confuse TCR and ECS

Both are measures of climate sensitivity.  TCR is defined to be temperature at the time CO2 doubles (while CO2 is still increasing at 1% per year), while ECS is after feedbacks have ""settled.""  You'll find TCR and ECS go hand in hand in the literature.  I.e., lower TCR results are found in the same papers as lower ECS results, generally speaking.

&gt;you should make a giant table...

*You* should try to respond with actual papers, not appeal to a pretend authority of consensus among the ""climate science community.""  So far, I've out-cited you by a factor of about 10:1.

&gt; but if the only reason you think that is because a handful of studies include values that low in their CI, you do not have a compelling argument.

You don't have a compelling argument by hand-waving dismissals and appeals to authority.  Show a recent survey of papers on climate sensitivity (ECS or TCR) if you want to even try to make an argument.

&gt;The biases are in the method not in the researcher perspective.

The biases of high-sensitivity papers are in relying on GCMs than can't model clouds: the major and immediate feedback.

&gt;Except there isn't. 

I don't see you citing papers.

&gt;a technique which the community widely agrees is biased low

"3546","cq3h1gw","1","0","t1_cq33vyk","Stevens gave his Ringberg talk a week after lewis posted his blog. Lewis [presented the ECS estimate using Stevnes new paper at Ringberg](http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/fileadmin/atmosphaere/WCRP_Grand_Challenge_Workshop/Ringberg_2015/Talks/Lewis_24032015.pdf). so it is safe to say that Stevens knows whats up. there isnt any thing else he could be responding to in his [open letter](http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/fileadmin/grafik/presse/News/AerosolForcing-Statement-BjornStevens.pdf). i dont see the point of arguing this; what else was he responding to in his statement? 

so i see a handful of arguments you raise:

First - as pointed out by /u/archiesteel, just because a paper is 'new' does not mean it is the best. as you say, ""*You can't dismiss so much literature so easily""! Most of the papers you cite use simplified EBMs. As I already pointed out to you an author of the most influential of those papers (Myles Allen, a co-author on the Otto paper) who is *also* the lead author of the AR5 chapter on climate sensitivity argues that those methods are biased low. And the reason for this is simple - they insufficiently model heat storage and transport in the ocean. need to pay attention to the other literature. The other literature uses different methods which may suffer from different flaws but you have to consider them appropriately. 

Second - giving a physical explanation (like the last sentence above) is not waving hands or an appeal to authority. giving a long list of papers *is* (especially when they dont all support your opinion like /u/archiesteel highlighted in this thread). but two people can play this game so ive provided an equally long list of papers at the end of this comment for you to read which argue for ECS &gt; Lewis' estimate. you can do with it what you want. I have already linked for you three talks - two by andy dessler and one by bjorn stevens - which lay out the physical explanations why ECS &gt; 2.0 much more succicntly and clearly than i can do in a short comment on an internet forum. if you have particular comments on them then i would love to hear them. since you ask ""*How many papers would you need to not claim I'm cherry picking?*"" that answer is very simple: all you need to do is highlight a few papers deriving ECS using different methods and make a case why *they're wrong*. you should at least sample a deep paleo-climate case, an LGM case, a theoretical case using a GCM, and a GCM applied to observational record. that covers most (but not all) of the bases. 

Third - the audience at schloss ringberg was rather clear in its assessment. *that's* the expert community. check out andy dessler's or gavin schmidt's tweets. gavin also [wrote a good blog post overviewing ringberg](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2015/04/reflections-on-ringberg/)

Fourth - you make much ado about clouds, but dessler and stevens pretty much eviscerate your assertion. first, whether or not fat tails in ECS distributions are from GCMs inadequately simulating clouds is not clear; inadequate simulation of internal variability is probably just as much a culprit (see Kyle Armour's work). second, improving the models simulation of two-way coupling between clouds and climate will likely chop off the bottom part of the ECS uncertainty range (where Lewis' and other estimates sit). As [Stevens points out](http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/fileadmin/atmosphaere/WCRP_Grand_Challenge_Workshop/Ringberg_2015/Talks/Stevens_Ringberg_Talk.pdf), there is no physical hypothesis except for Iris which uses clouds to lower ECS. and Iris is a dead-in-the-water wrong-is-wrong theory utterly inconsistent with satellite observations.

Of course not; however, newer papers build on what has come before.

&gt;giving a physical explanation (like the last sentence above) is not waving hands or an appeal to authority. 

I didn't say the single sentence was either waving hands or an appeal to authority.  I said *you* did those things.  I said it wasn't a critique, which it isn't.  He have nothing quantitative in that sentence, yet you are treating it as a death blow to Lewis's calculations.  

&gt;but two people can play this game so ive provided an equally long list of papers at the end of this comment

So I see, though I note you didn't bother summarizing any of them.  What do the authors find in terms of ECS?  TCR?

&gt;all you need to do is highlight a few papers deriving ECS using different methods and make a case why they're wrong.

[*Gish gallop follows*.]  You know very well that until the cloud issue is resolved, GCMs can't possibly produce low ECS.

&gt;the audience at schloss ringberg was rather clear in its assessment. that's the expert community. 

And you accuse me of cherry picking.

&gt;check out andy dessler's or gavin schmidt's tweets. 

Why  is Dessler or Schmidt more right than Lewis, Ring, Masters, or any of  the others I've cited?

&gt;you make much ado about clouds, but dessler and stevens pretty much eviscerate your assertion.

Then they disagree with Gavin, who just wrote:

""There were two major themes that emerged across a lot of the discussions: the stability of the basic ‘energy balance’ equation  that defines the sensitivity; and the challenge of estimating cloud feedbacks from process-based understanding. The connection occurs because the clouds are the cause of the biggest variation in sensitivity across GCMs.""

&gt;inadequate simulation of internal variability is probably just as much a culprit (see Kyle Armour's work).

You seem to be noting problems with GCMs now.  Are you prepared to accept the idea that their flaws affect sensitivity estimates derived from them?

&gt;and Iris is a dead-in-the-water wrong-is-wrong theory utterly inconsistent with satellite observations.

That's exactly the opposite of what Bony just presented at Ringberg:

http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/fileadmin/atmosphaere/WCRP_Grand_Challenge_Workshop/Ringberg_2015/Talks/Bony_26032016.pdf

Curry summarizes that workshop thusly:

""There is evidence for an Iris effect . . . but not for a negative cloud feedback associated with it (so far).  Could a change in convective organization with temperature affect this feedback?  Remains to be investigated.""

&gt;there we can we not play the stupid ""i have more paper sthan you do"" pissing match.

and you have to understand them in the context of what has come before. Otto/Lewis and EBM papers carve a particular niche they do not overhaul the entire field.

&gt;  I said it wasn't a critique, which it isn't. He have nothing quantitative in that sentence, yet you are treating it as a death blow to Lewis's calculations.

??? it's an important very basic *qualitative* comment about lewis' calculations. you havent refute it (youre ignoring the substance of the very straightforward criticism - that the lewis EBM misses some ocean processes which must bias his result low). if you disagree then please explain why.id like to know your perspective. 

&gt; So I see, though I note you didn't bother summarizing any of them. What do the authors find in terms of ECS? TCR?

?? You didnt summarize them, you quote-mined from a few of them and gave a list for the rest of them. i have to assume you have read them all already since you are so eager to reject them and accept Lewis! the point was that i, too, can provide you an arbitrary long list of articles with ECS between different values. that says nothing about the broader ECS discussion other than different papers with different flaws and caveats get different answers. one paper is not the answer. 10 papers is not hte answer. *all* the papers are the answer. except propbably papers like otto/lewis becuase its wrong

thats a joke. but it does have biases that you hsould consider when interpreting it in context.

&gt; ou know very well that until the cloud issue is resolved, GCMs can't possibly produce low ECS.

give me any climate model with coupled aerosol/chemistry i can arbitrary tune it to as low an ECS as i want. do it in the dust emissions, the *real* secret of the AOGCM community!

my cloud argument is pretty straightforward, so i'll repeat it in one sentence: its unforced variability in the models that keeps ECS high, not clouds! actually its not my argument is Stevens argument its Desslers argument its Fassullo/Treneberth argument.

&gt; And you accuse me of cherry picking.

well, ya did! its a limitation of arguing on reddit, see it all the time when people bicker on /r/science. understandable, but in this case the argument is about broader context so its kinda important to point out where information gets de-contextualized.

&gt; Why is Dessler or Schmidt more right than Lewis, Ring, Masters, or any of the others I've cited?

because their arguments are based physics from first principles. i trust that any day than a mathematical black box which blends a medium-complexity climate model rife with assumptions and paired with observational data that is full of uncertainty! its called 'making sausage.' when you see where its made youre less liekly to eat it. 

&gt; Then they disagree with Gavin, who just wrote:

read what gavin wrote!!!

the second theme he describes is on ""estimating cloud feedbacks from a process-based understanding"". just because they are a source of **inter-model uncertainty** with respect to climate sensitivity does not mean they are major holdup in the broader discussion. and yes, Andy would *definitely* disagree with Gavin on the relative contribution of cloud feedbacks to uncertainty in ECS. but again, the point that you made was that the uncertainty in representing cloud processes in models is where the upper end of the ecs uncertainty lies. its not, it effects the mean values you get from different models, all of which are generally lower than the fat tail, or at least lower than 3.5-4 C

&gt; You seem to be noting problems with GCMs now. Are you prepared to accept the idea that their flaws affect sensitivity estimates derived from them?

GCMs have as many caveats and advantages as EBMs do, or LGM data, or deep paleo data, or any other source. no where did i say otherwise. please do not put words in my mouth; i think ive been rather clear thay **ALL** the methods have problems which is why you have to contextualize all of them. Even Lewis does this in a very nice table in his ringberg slides! (although hes ever the salesman and is far too generous with his assessment of his method)

&gt; That's exactly the opposite of what Bony just presented at Ringberg:

Perhaps. i will believe it when other groups extend the Zelinka/Hartmann result. Here is what Bony says:

""*No strong evidence (so far) that GCMs miss a negative cloud feedback associated
with the Iris effect*""

so if the cloudfields respond in a way that Iris predicts but it produces a different feedback is it the Iris effect? serious question. 

Furthermore, check out the other two conclusions from Bony:

""*Process-oriented observational constraints suggest that lowest-sensitivity models
under-estimate the positive low-cloud feedback*""

and

""*Suggests that models with ECS lower than 3K are unlikely to be realistic*""

So Sandrine kinda shoots down your hypothesis that clouds are the missing link between the Lewis estimates and physics that the models get wrong or are missing

I'll tell you what.  I'll write a quick summary of my position, and we'll (hopefully) part on good terms.

There are lots of estimates of ECS.  There has been a general trend in papers reducing the estimate of ECS and TCR from AR4 values, especially at the top end.  Whereas AR4 and AR5 listed 4.5°C as the high end of their likely range, most papers are reducing that to 4° or even 3.5°.  

Given that AR5 shifted the low end of the likely range from AR4's 2° to 1.5°, it is premature to claim that 2° really should be the low end of the range.  To say that such a thing is consensus flies in the face of the IPCC report.  

Peer-review takes time.  The range of ECS stayed pretty static for 30 years because of difficulties in estimating the upper end of likely values.  It seems that finally, estimates of ECS are narrowing a bit, and certainly that likely range has come down from 2-4.5°.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_312bx2",1428423220,2015-04-07 16:13:40,"Will_Power"

however, there are some holes in your summary which i hope you will consider 

first, the 'trend in papers reducing the estimate of ECS and TCR from AR4 values' is not indicative of condensed knowledge; its that right now, certain methods are in vogue which tend to:

- produce lower estimates of those values due to assumptions they make (EBMs missing physics of ocean heat storage)

- are unable to sufficiently probe the fat tail of the distribution (especially ones which only look at modern instrumental record)

there's no sea change in our understanding of ECS. #Ringberg2015 is the best example of that - most people in the community are more than convinced from the balance of evidence that ECS is &gt; 3.0 but &lt; 4.5. some people even chop off the fat tail even more and that is totally reasonable and has been even pre-AR5. 

AR5 reflects the literature of as of mid-2013. it would be unfair to exclude papers like Otto or Aldrin, even if they are potentially biased low. The drop in the lower range of the CI for AR5 reflects in general terms that new techniques probe this part of the uncertainty interval and come out to disagreement with prior methods. You *cannot* confuse a change in the bounds of the CI with a new estimate of the most likely value within that CI! that is you cannot make assumption about shape of PDF within CI; AR5 authors opted not to assess that part of the uncertainty.

It is not premature to claim that ECS &gt; 2.0. See the Ringberg talks. there is **plenty** of evidence that ECS is probably not lower than 2.0, regardless of what Nic Lewis thinks. Physics trumps.

&gt; The range of ECS stayed pretty static for 30 years because of difficulties in estimating the upper end of likely values.

from the perspective of the climate science community, ECS has not changed since the Charney Report. youre really overstating the case for EBM-based assessments and the impact they have on the broader ECS estimation.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_312bx2",1428426084,2015-04-07 17:01:24,"idisagroo"

You are aware that some of the papers you cited suggested a lowering of the top-end of the AR4/AR5 range, I hope.

&gt;there's no sea change in our understanding of ECS. 

There's never a sea change on a topic related to predicting the outcome of a non-linear, coupled, chaotic system, nor did I claim there was.  What there *was* at Ringberg was a whittling down of the top end of ECS estimates.  Note as well that Ringberg was rather limited in the number of participants.  Of the then papers I cited, only Lewis was present among those authors.  It was a self-selected group.

&gt;AR5 reflects the literature of as of mid-2013.

Yet you keep claiming that there is some sort of consensus that ECS &gt; 2.0.  That can't be justified in light of AR5.  We will have to wait until AR6 for another such broad survey.

&gt;You cannot confuse a change in the bounds of the CI with a new estimate of the most likely value within that CI!

But as you noted, the authors of AR5 declined to identify a most likely value because of the disagreement in the literature.  The literature has not advanced so much in the last two years as to bring that much certainty to the likely range of sensitivity.

for three decades there have been papers that either have a fat tail or do not. i dont see that changing. some methods are sensitive enough to probe that part of the ECS range and others arent. some methods are unable to minimize the probability in that part of the range and others arent. again you must consider everything.

&gt; What there was at Ringberg was a whittling down of the top end of ECS estimates. 

perhaps when you go back through the literature youll realize that the fat tails have been hotly contested for a long time and nothing new has changed that. some researchers reject fat tails offhand for the same simple physical principles that they use to limit hte lower bound of ECS

and again this kind of misses the more important point of what is the most **likely** value for ECS. whittling bounds doesn't change that target.

&gt; Yet you keep claiming that there is some sort of consensus that ECS &gt; 2.0. That can't be justified in light of AR5. We will have to wait until AR6 for another such broad survey.

read the slides from ringberg. the *only* person who suggests ECS &lt; 2.0 is Lewis. 

we do not have to wait for another such broad survey. we can look at the slides from ringberg, which assessed the current state of knowledge in order to figure out a path forward. thats what WCRPs are for.

&gt; But as you noted, the authors of AR5 declined to identify a most likely value because of the disagreement in the literature.

which fyi doesnt say anything about whether or not ECS is more likely to be higher or lower and does not endorse a particular side. as always its the IPCC being very conservative just like they are on sea level rise.

&gt; It absolutely is, for the reasons I've cited. 

You did not cite any reasons other than a handful of papers with known biases produce lower estimates. that wasn't convincing for the experts at ringberg so why should you expect it to be convincing for me or anyone else? you have only justified your preference for Otto/Lewis by suggesting that GCMs fail to model clouds in such a way that it biases their ECS assessment *too low*. if we ignore the fact that you didn't justify *why* that's the particular way they're biased (the talk I gave you from Dessler argues the exact *opposite*) then why do you also ignore paleo estimates? The Johansson paper?

&gt; Please don't try to use one single convention as evidence that a major change from AR4 to AR5 is suddenly resolved.

Please don't try to use a handful of papers with known biases as evidence that a major uncertainty in the likely value of ECS is suddenly resolved.

In 2013, [a monumental paper](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n6/pdf/ngeo1836.pdf) was published by the following researchers:

- Alexander Otto

- Friederike E. L. OttoO

- Olivier Boucher

- John Church

- Gabi Hegerl

- Piers M. Forster

- Gregory C. Johnson

- Gunnar Myhre

- Drew Shindell

- Bjorn Stevens

- Myles R. Allen

If you know anything about climate sensitivity, you'll recognize most of those names.  James Annan, another name you should recognize, [wrote the following](http://julesandjames.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-chink-of-light-at-end-of-tunnel.html) regarding that paper:

""**At last the great and the good have spoken.** There's a new article in Nature Geoscience (here, but the bulk of the details are in the SI which seems to not be paywalled) concerning the energy balance of the climate system, which basically confirms what had already been presented in the slew of recent papers pointing to a lowering of climate sensitivity estimates.

""The analysis itself is not particularly novel or exciting: what makes it newsworthy in my view is the list of authors, which includes some who had previously been trying to talk down these recent estimates (e.g. Knutti: ""my personal view is that the overall assessment hasn’t changed much""). Even though this paper is too late for the IPCC AR5, I hope it reflects a change in thinking from the IPCC authors involved. (Notable also that Nic Lewis is involved.)

""...The contrasting claim that the analysis of transient response gives a qualitatively different outcome (being somewhat lower than both the previous IPCC assessment, and the range obtained from GCMs) is just weird, since both their ECS and TCR results are markedly lower than the IPCC and GCM ranges.

""This looks like a pretty unreasonable attempt to spin the result as nothing new for sensitivity, when it is clearly something very new indeed from these authors, and implies a marked lowering of the IPCC 'likely' range. Although the paper does not explicitly mention it, the 'likely' range for equilibrium climate sensitivity using the full 40y of data seems to be about 1.3-3C (reading off the graph by eye, the lower end may be off a bit due to the nonlinear scale). So although the analysis does depend on a few approximations and simplifications, it's hard to see how they could continue to defend the 2-4.5C range.""

From the paper itself:

""**The most likely value of equilibrium climate sensitivity based on the energy budget of the most recent decade is 2.0°C**, with a 5–95% confidence interval of 1.2– 3.9°C."" 

So there you have it.  The best researchers in the field together write that the best estimate for ECS is 2.0°C.  You'll forgive me if I don't find your nattering about how we now know for sure that ECS &gt; 2.0°C very compelling.  

You've wasted enough of my time.  I won't bother reading any further replies from you unless you start with the header, ""Why the paper you just cited is wrong, /u/Will_Power"" and then proceed to:

- give strong evidence that it's wrong.

- cite any of the co-authors who have since withdrawn their name from the paper, and/or

- show evidence that the paper has been withdrawn or retracted.

&gt; Most current climate models take the variety of clouds that form over the oceans and average them out to a single type - stratocumulus clouds or cumulus clouds - which cover tens to hundreds of kilometers.

&gt; Specifically, they found climate models that simply averaged one type of cloud underestimated the actual amount of ocean cloud cover, which in turn led to an overestimation of how much of the sun&amp;#039;s energy was reaching the ocean.

&gt; This leads models to predict a quicker change from flattened stratocumulus clouds to the puffy cumulus clouds and also introduces uncertainties into climate projections.

&gt; A possible practical future use of this discovery could be to include clays in CO2 filters for industrial-scale CO2 emissions reduction.

&gt; The researchers found that CO2 in gaseous form binds to smectite, and that it is not only the smectite clay surfaces in themselves that are responsible for binding CO2, but principally that ions associated with the clay surfaces are the active capturers.

&gt; The CO2 that is captured by the clay is released when it is heated to temperatures above this limit, which allows CO2 capture to be controlled.

Remember, of course, that Archimedes' principle states that a floating object will displace a weight of the fluid it is submerged in that is equal to its own weight. So the weight of displaced sea water, in this case, must be equal to the weight *W* of the floating ice. 

We know the volume of the displaced sea water - that's the same as the volume of the submerged ice, which we defined in equation 1 as V2. 

Which brings us to equation 3:

*W = ρ0gV2*

where*W* is the weight of the floating ice, *ρ0* is the density of sea water, *g* is the acceleration of gravity, and *V2* is the volume of submerged ice (or more to the point the volume of displaced sea water).

&gt; The paper is an outcome of the Permafrost Carbon Network, a group of more than 200 scientists from 88 research institutions in 17 countries who for four years have studied changes in the Arctic.

&gt; As the climate warms and permafrost thaws, microbes decompose organic material in permafrost, releasing carbon dioxide or more potent methane.

This would be true *in fresh water*. But this is not fresh water, this is salt water. So the submerged portion of the ice is less than the volume of water it would melt into.

The irony is that the math is based on exactly what you're saying here - the mass of water is unchanged, but water expands when it freezes. Of course it takes the expansion into account - in the basic assumption that ice will float, displacing a volume of sea water equal to it's weight. 

So because salt water is denser than fresh, the water level will rise slightly when the ice melts. Which is what the math shows. And what his empirical experiment confirmed. It's trivially, obviously true. Obviously you can't follow basic arithmetic (sorry, 'calculus') but I think the bigger factor is that you somehow think that if you can prove this untrue (you can't) that that somehow says something about the truth of climate change science (it won't).

Your source even shows that its the rate of change. Source also shows that CO2 is now twice as high as it was during the Jurasic (210ppm jur. Vs 400ppm presently). [Source](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere).
The rate of change right now is litterally so high, that your graph cant even show it on the time scale in such a short period of time.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_32g1ux",1429143153,2015-04-16 00:12:33,"the_weather_man_"

&gt; Using records stretching back to 1791, the study finds that a switch in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation or PDO has always been accompanied by changes in temperature in the north and south Pacific Ocean.

&gt; &amp;quot;Because the ocean is in contact with the atmosphere, there&amp;#039;s heat exchange between the atmosphere and the surface ocean,&amp;quot; he said.

&gt; Looking backward to a hotter futureScientists are only now coming to understand the PDO and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, which is the wind-and-ocean circulation that extends across the entire Pacific Ocean of which the PDO is a part.

&gt; After two years of decline, total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere because of human activity increased 2 percent in 2013 over the previous year.

&gt; Emissions across nearly all sectors grew in 2013, with increased GHG emissions from electricity generation, more vehicle miles traveled on the nation&amp;#039;s roadways and greater industrial production, according to the EPA.

&gt; The news of the increase in U.S. human-caused GHG emissions comes at a critical moment in the global battle against climate change, particularly after the International Energy Agency announced last month that global carbon emissions related to energy consumption have stabilized for the first time in a growing economy.

"3716","cqjtw1w","2","0","t1_cqji3zr","&gt; So ""rock solid"" that it's not been cited.

Remember when this was your whole argument, that it hadn't been cited, and then I proved to you several times that it had, in fact, been cited multiple times? And besides, I don't think a denier like yourself would really like to use ""prominence in the scientific literature"" as a metric for something's validity. Yeah, this must be embarrassing for you. 

&gt; So ""rock solid"" that it doesn't figure at all in IPCC sea level projections.

Actually the IPCC projections of sea level cite the work of Jenkins and Holland (Jenkins, A., and D. Holland, 2007: Melting of floating ice and sea level rise. Geophys. Res. Lett., 34, L16609.), which is, in turn, explicitly based on (and cites, of course) Noerdlinger's paper. So that means your first two statements are demonstrably false. 

&gt;So ""rock solid"" that you're the only person, ever, on this site who's brought it up. 

Obscure scientific paper not brought up on Reddit? The ultimate measure of it's truth! Needless to say, any paper that hasn't been discussed on Reddit is clearly BS. So says the guy who doesn't know what calculus is but is an expert in how science works. 

&gt;So ""rock solid"" that presenting it for scrutiny to others scares you shitless.

It doesn't scare me, I just don't see the point. I can post it, people will parrot the erroneous but common misconception that melting floating ice will not impact sea levels at all, and then I'm the one who will come in to provide the peer-reviewed scientific paper that answers the very question I asked. It's weird to ask a question on AskScience that I already know the answer to. If you want to post it there go for it - I'm happy to drop by and answer the question complete with links to peer-reviewed literature. 

I was going to post it to /r/science but it's more than 6 months old so is against their rules. If you can suggest a forum where posting an older paper for discussion is appropriate I'm more than happy to do it, but neither /r/askscience nor /r/science are it. (edit: posted to /r/EverythingScience, which seems like the right place. [I'm shaking in my boots](http://www.reddit.com/r/EverythingScience/comments/33dkf8/contrary_to_popular_belief_melting_sea_ice_does/).)

&gt;AGW mania relies on the art of suckering the credulous through feeding them what they want to see. But that paper is a case where all of the credulous people, except you, saw through it.

If you really want to learn about climate change, I suggest recognizing two things right off the bat:

- Climate change isn't binary.  It isn't 100% man-made and it isn't 100% natural.

- Climate science is the most politicized of all fields of science.  Partisans on both poles of the political spectrum put out a great deal of misinformation on the subject.

With those caveats in mind, let's look at a few topics to give you a starting place with your friend.  I'll be copying most of what follows from some fairly recent comments I've made in this sub where people have had disagreements with friends or family about climate change: [source 1,](http://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/30atd1/what_are_the_best_argumentspoints_to_shut_up_a/cpqqokp) [source 2.](http://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/2zau9o/my_dad_is_a_climate_change_skeptic/cphqk3t)

I encourage you to ask these questions of your friend and answer them yourself, then compare notes:

1.  Is CO2 a greenhouse gas?

2.  Has there been an increase in CO2 since the industrial era?

3.  What is the direct effect of doubling atmospheric CO2?  (This is known as the Stefan-Boltzmann equilibrium.  To get specific, pre-industrial levels of CO2 were ~280 ppm; today it's ~400 ppm; a doubling would be ~560 ppm.)

4.  What are climate feedbacks and are they net negative or net positive?  (Negative feedbacks are those that reverse direction of a change; e.g., an air conditioner.  Positive feedbacks are those that accelerate a change; e.g., a stock market rally.)

5.  How much warming is expected per doubling of atmospheric CO2 (including feedbacks) at the time that number is reached?  (This value is known as TCR, or Transient Climate Response.)

6.  How much warming is expected per doubling of atmospheric CO2 once all feedbacks have stabilized?  (This is known as ECS, or Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity.)

7.  How many economically viable fossil fuel reserves remain and how much will they raise atmospheric CO2 if burned?

You'll find general consensus among scientists on some of those questions and wide disagreements on others.  Hopefully the questions themselves will give you the key terms required to research topics further.

Good luck in your discussion.  I think if you go in with the right attitude you can have a really productive discussion with your friend.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_33gbuy",1429718415,2015-04-22 16:00:15,"Will_Power"

&gt;AGW is so desperate to prove itself that all manners of crap papers are published and there is a ready audience of credulous believers to lap it all up.

For the billionth time, this paper says nothing about the truth or falsehood of climate change. 

&gt;Angry monkey-typing kid. It's as if you figure that you've uncovered a lost testament.

What? I have never held this article up as having any huge significance. You're the one who seems to think that disproving it is critical to your worldview. It's just one of the many thousands of minor articles that are published every year, the vast majority of which are not cited terribly often, and are never mentioned on Reddit. 

&gt;So do it. Become a martyr. 

If you'd read all I wrote you'd see that I did just that only minutes after posting. I posted it in /r/EverythingScience, where it has been savaged with upvotes and one request for clarification. My poor reputation is in shambles. 

I can't tell if you're really too slow to understand the argument in the paper (which is trivially easy to follow for anyone with a basic physics or math background), or if you didn't even try because you're so threatened (for reasons I still don't fully grok) by its implications. 

Your arguments to date:

* It's wrong because it hasn't been cited (false and irrelevant)
* It's wrong because it hasn't been mentioned on Reddit (irrelevant and likely false)
* It's wrong because it wasn't included in the IPCC reports (false, irrelevant, and a surprising choice of an authority to lean on for you)
* It's wrong  because it was a ""heated sample"" (false, the ice was melted, that's it - the water was at room temperature for both measurements)
* It's wrong  because the math didn't include the expansion of ice as it freezes (false because the only reason that's relevant is that it causes ice to float)
* It's wrong because I want it to be true (I don't actually care much one way or the other, but my desire would have no impact on the actual argument)
* It's wrong because it scares you and makes you feel insecure (Oh wait you haven't explicitly made that one yet)

You're so extraordinarily out of your depth it's really fascinating to watch. You literally have no idea what you're talking about but use words you don't really understand to try to sound smart (""calculus"", ""Essay by abstract"", ""heated sample""). There's no shame in ignorance. There is tremendous shame in willful ignorance and incuriousity. 

I think I'm done here. It was entertaining to watch you squirm for a while, but it's getting boring, and it's clear that you have zero interest in learning from those who are dramatically more experienced than you.

I'm unsure which aspects of 'man-made global warming' theory you are thinking about in particular, so I'll take the basics first: human activities emit CO2, CO2 causes climate warming, CO2 and other greenhouse gases have caused most of the warming since the 1850s. I'm sure there are other, better ways to go about demonstrating this but I do have actual work to do :).

**Human acitivities emit CO2**

Prediction: We should observe an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration.

Outcome: We do.

Prediction: The carbon in that CO2 should be isotopically light, because we hypothesise it has come from burning fossil fuels.

Outcome: It is.

**CO2 absorbs infrared radiation**

Prediction: We should be able to measure the depletion of a beam on infrared radiation shone through a tube containing CO2 gas.

Outcome: We can.

**CO2 and other greenhouse gases have caused most of the warming since the 1850s**

Prediction: Without accounting for the changes in greenhouse gases we should be unable to explain the warming since the 1850s.

Outcome: We can't.

Prediction: Nights should warm faster than days because at night-time the surface is almost exclusively cooled by infrared radiation, which CO2 blocks.

Outcome: They have.""","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_33iqkj",1429876278,2015-04-24 11:51:18,"donaldosaurus"

"3793","cqna7b8","3","0","t1_cqm2scx","Lewis and Stevens have just commented on the SciAm article.  

Lewis:

&gt;A Scientific American article concerning Bjorn Stevens’ recent paper “Rethinking the lower bound on aerosol radiative forcing” has led to some confusion. The article states, referring to a blog post of mine at Climate Audit, “The misinterpretation of Stevens’ paper began with Nic Lewis, an independent climate scientist.”. My blog post showed how climate sensitivity estimates given in Lewis and Curry (2014) (LC14) would change if the estimate for aerosol forcing from Stevens’ recent paper were used instead of the estimate thereof given in the IPCC 5th Assessment Working Group 1 report (AR5 WG1). To clarify, Bjorn Stevens has never suggested that my blog post misinterpreted or misrepresented his paper.
&gt;
&gt;The article also states, paraphrasing rather than quoting, “Lewis had used an extremely rudimentary, some would even say flawed, climate model to derive his estimates, Stevens said.” LC14 used a simple energy budget climate model, described in AR5 WG1, to estimate equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) from estimates of climate system changes over the last 150 years or so. An essentially identical method was used to estimate ECS in Otto et al (2013), a paper of which Bjorn Stevens was an author, along with thirteen other AR5 WG1 lead authors (and myself). Energy budget models actually estimate an approximation to ECS, effective climate sensitivity, not ECS itself, which some people may regard as a flaw. AR5 WG1 states that “In some climate models ECS tends to be higher than the effective climate sensitivity”; this is certainly true. Since the climate system takes many centuries to equilibrate, it is not known whether or not this is the case in the real climate system. LC14 discussed the issues involved in some detail, and my Climate Audit blog post referred to estimating “equilibrium/effective climate sensitivity”.

Stevens then commented on those paragraphs:

&gt;Dear Nic,
&gt;
&gt;because I have reservations about estimates of ocean heat uptake used in the ‘energy-balance approaches’, and because of a number of issues (which you allude to) regarding differences between effective climate sensitivity estimates from the historical record and ECS, I am not ready to draw the inference from my study that ECS is low. That said, I do think what you write in the two paragraphs above is a fair characterization of the situation and of your important contributions to the scientific debate. The Ringberg meeting also made me confident that the open issues are ones we can resolve in the next few years.
&gt;
&gt;Feel free to quote me on this.
&gt;
&gt;Best wishes, Bjorn

It's not a straw man argument. It's an argument by analogy, intended to show that even if some scientists have made bad predictions in the past, that doesn't mean all scientists lose their authority to speak on the subject. I literally assumed your premise (that all scientific predictions regarding climate change have failed) was true, and offered an explanation as to why you should believe them, even if your premise was true. (-It's not) 

&gt;want to tax me more, here take my money!

At what point did I mention, reference, or even bring up the topic of taxation? But since you seem so keen on attempting to identify fallacies, the one you're using here is known as a non sequitur fallacy. Your assumption that I am somehow in favor in increasing *your* taxes, does not logically follow from the response I gave in attempting to answer your question. In fact it wasn't even mentioned. 

&gt;should i become vegan now too?

Another non sequitur, and no. Although you *should* learn to capitalize your sentences, as it would do wonders to help your intellectual credibility. 

You asked a question on a subreddit devoted to climate change, and I gave you a response directly related to the content of that question. In response, you claimed that I was a) trying to scare you, that I b) desire to tax you more, and bizarrely that I c) am concerned about your dietary preferences. I'm not. 

I simply tried to answer your factually incorrect and loaded question in as general a way possible, in the hopes that the logic underlying my response would be simple enough for you to understand. Clearly it wasn't, and I made the mistake of assuming your question was sincere. Judging by your post history, it definitely wasn't. 

You ventured out of the sports and religious apologists subreddits you frequent, came here to post this juvenile question, thinking you were being edgy by linking to a denier website whose claims are self-defeating, and then decided to make baseless assumptions about the political and nutritional inclinations of the first person who attempted to give you a sincere response.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_33iqkj",1429910425,2015-04-24 21:20:25,"LAULitics"

&gt; DISEASES WILL SPREAD FASTER BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE Infectious diseases, such as Ebola and West Nile virus, will rapidly spread to new areas as a result of global warming.

&gt; &amp;#039;Our model shows these wiggles can be big enough that they could have accounted for a reasonable portion of the accelerated warming we experienced from 1975 to 2000, as well as the reduced rate in warming that occurred from 2002 to 2013.&amp;#039;.

&gt; &amp;#039;Statistically, it&amp;#039;s pretty unlikely that an 11-year hiatus in warming, like the one we saw at the start of this century, would occur if the underlying human-caused warming was progressing at a rate as fast as the most severe IPCC projections,&amp;#039; Brown said.

Grow up. Read the arguments against your position. If, after you have done the the research, you are unconvinced, then you will come away from the research better prepared to argue in support of your currently, and self-admittedly uninformed opinion.

The onus does not lie upon me to inform you, upon request, of the relative scientific findings, in a discussion regarding climatological, atmospheric, oceanic, and ecological epistemology.

But I'm not going to fall for, or respond to the YouTube comment worthy games you're playing here.

You are a grown person. You have an intellectual obligation to yourself to understand the world as best as you can, and do everything in you power to fight for what you believe in after having established a relatively informed perspective on a particular problem or issue.

In this example, you are assuming that my ""authority"" has no mechanism by which to self-regulate, or that the authority is unchallenged.

If we're being honest you are, in a way arguing semantics. I speak of scientists generally because they tend to try and correlate their findings in different fields.

&gt; Evidence from the end of the last Ice Age has already shown that the planet&amp;#039;s uneasy web of seismic faults - cracks in the crust like the one that runs along the Himalayas - are very sensitive to the small pressure changes brought by change in the climate.

&gt; Some of McGuire&amp;#039;s colleagues believe he overstates the earthquake risk of sea-level rise and changing rainfall.

&gt; What can we do? McGuire thinks there&amp;#039;s little, other than mapping the &amp;quot;Coiled spring&amp;quot; that is the world&amp;#039;s seismic faults with an eye to where climate and sea-level change may trigger events.

&gt; As the nation warily watches every Republican presidential candidate kiss the ring of billionaire donor Charles Koch for a shot at his network&amp;#039;s $300,000,000 pool of presidential cash, Charles Koch did something unusual.

&gt; Charles&amp;#039;s Koch top strategist Richard Fink indicated that we may see a shift in Koch&amp;#039;s rhetoric on climate change.

&gt; Why focus on Charles Koch and David Koch? Many large foundations associated with corporate fortunes are active in financing climate denial groups - Anschutz, Bradley, Coors, DeVos, Dunn, Howard, Pope, Scaife, Searle, and Seid, to name a few.

&gt; &amp;quot;If society stays on its current trajectory of CO2 emissions and the growth rates of plants don&amp;#039;t increase as much as many models project, the result by the end of the century could be more extreme than we predicted,&amp;quot; said Cory Cleveland, a UM associate professor of biogeochemistry.

&gt; Most of the world&amp;#039;s leading climate models assume that plants will respond to increased atmospheric levels of CO2 by growing more and more, which is known as the CO2 fertilization effect.

&gt; The more the plants grow, the more CO2 they absorb from the atmosphere, thereby slowing climate change.

&gt; Global warming has profoundly changed the odds of extreme heat, rain and snowfall, researchers report on 27 April in Nature Climate Change.

&gt; Climate change caused by human activities currently drives 75% of daily heat extremes and 18% of heavy rain or snowfall events, the team found-warning that further global warming will sharply increase the risks of such weather.

&gt; If the world were to warm by 2 &amp;deg;C above the pre-industrial level, human-caused climate change would drive 40% of rain and snow extremes and 96% of heat extremes, the researchers found.

&gt; It&amp;#039;s called the &amp;quot;Biological pump,&amp;quot; and if it operated 100 percent efficiently, nearly every atom of carbon drawn into the ocean would be converted to organic carbon, sink into the deep ocean, and remain sequestered from the atmosphere for millennia.

&gt; Scientists investigating what controls the fate of carbon in the ocean have explored factors such as how easily phytoplankton particles break down, how much carbon they contain, and how fast they sink.

&gt; Edwards sees the research as a steppingstone toward a clearer understanding of CO2 absorption in the ocean and the efficiency of the biological pump in the vast planetary cycle that circulates carbon through air, land, ocean, and living things.

It is generally accepted that these cycles are what's responsible for the shift back and forth over the last several hundred thousand years from glacial periods to interglacials (like the one we are in now).  

As you point out, the warming during the 20th century was about 1.4°F or about 0.8°C.  There was a warming trend prior to the 1940s, then a slight cooling trend, then a warming trend from about 1970 to 2000.  There are debates over the causes of the two warming trends.  Most scientists attribute the majority of first warming period to natural causes, especially an increase in solar activity.  The IPCC in particular has stated that most (i.e., at least 50%) of the warming during the second period is due to mankind.  There are climate scientists who dispute that attribution, but nearly all climate scientists attribute at least some of the warming to mankind.

You are incorrect to state that CO2 concentrations have been increasing over the last 2 million years.  During the present ice age (yes, we are in an ice age), CO2 concentration dropped significantly, especially during glacial periods.  It was so low at certain times that plants were barely able to survive.  The present CO2 concentration of ~400 ppm is higher than during previous interglacials, but much lower than the earth experienced in the past.

Here's my take on the questions you ask in your final paragraph: ""climate change"" is a really poor term to describe what people want to talk about in recent history because the climate has always changed and always will.  When we talk about recent warming (last 100-200 years), there is a tendency among the uninformed to claim it is 100% natural or 100% manmade.  Both positions are false.  Mankind has had at least some impact, but natural variation has also played a role.  How much is due to each is surprisingly difficult to estimate.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_34e6xg",1430410011,2015-04-30 16:06:51,"Will_Power"

So for me it does not matter anymore if humans are the cause or not.  It is clear that humans produce a lot of CO2 in addition to natural CO2 emission, that additional CO2 may or may not cause temperature rise.

What is clear to me is that Greenland and Antarctica are melting and that water has to go somewhere, so we will see major flooding of coastal areas, my guess is within the next 100 years or so...

I tend to trust NASA scientists more because they have awesome lasers they use to measure the thickness of the ice in Antarctica ;), so my advice is do not buy any property near the coast ;)

There's a classical view of climate change that is very different from what we're being told today. The classical view, in a nutshell, is this: Given the current geography of Earth and stage of the Milankovitch cycle we expect that the planet has settled around a climate mean that varies naturally due to competing feedback mechanisms. For instance, warmth increases evaporation over time leading to an increase in cloud cover that leads eventually to natural cooling. Milankovitch cycles play a role in overturning the current climate regime on the order of thousands of years. Within those cycles climate varies around a mean on the order of hundreds of years. Within those hundreds year periods are the short term modifiers such as ENSO. Climate may only effect the thin skin and atmosphere of Earth, but that is still a very large area that takes time to warm and time to cool. Feedback mechanisms can't shift temperature trends quickly.

Within the last 1000 years Earth has swung from (what some would call) the extreme heat of the Medieval Warming Period (MWP) to the extreme cold of the Little Ice-Age (LIA) and back to the current warming period. So, despite any supposed human contribution Earth would be warming anyway as the cycles progress. 

Keep in mind that Earth is a water planet and it's all that water that is the major contributor to climate variation. It's accepted that water in the atmosphere is responsible for a 30C difference in the global temperature that we would expect given out planet's distance from the sun. By far, water is the most important of ""greenhouse"" gases. An increase in global humidity has accompanied the current warming. This has been attributed by AGW proponants to be due to CO2 ""forcing"", meaning that the increase in CO2 has caused sufficient warming to drive higher evaporation rates. But there's no evidence that's the case.  

As much as they like to protest the point, AGW has a very weak case. Right now human CO2 output contributes about 2% above the natural output (6gt vs 300gt) and is falling behind further as warming causes the release of yet more sequestered CO2 from soils and the ocean. Considering that the current warming has not yet come close to that of the MWP we can expect a huge increase in CO2 levels from those natural sequestered sources. The high CO2 level of the MWP did nothing to prevent the onset of the LIA so there is really no reason to think that the paltry human ccontribution wil have any effect either.

Doesn't really matter as human activity is putting *new* CO2 in circulation, whereas the ""natural ouput"" is CO2 that is already part of the carbon cycle.

&gt;and is falling behind further as warming causes the release of yet more sequestered CO2 from soils and the ocean

Actually, the amount produced by human beings is currently much higher than CO2 outgassing.

&gt;Considering that the current warming has not yet come close to that of the MWP

It's actually higher than the MWP, if you look at the entire globe.

&gt;The high CO2 level of the MWP did nothing to prevent the onset of the LIA 

CO2 is now *much* higher than it was during the MWP.

&gt; OSLO, April 30 - Climate change could drive up to a sixth of animals and plants on Earth to extinction unless governments cut rising greenhouse gas emissions, according to a U.S. study published on Thursday.

&gt; The study averaged out 131 previous studies of climate change, whose projections of the number of species that could be lost to climate change ranged from zero to 54 percent of species worldwide - too wide to be useful in designing conservation policies.

&gt; A temperature rise so far of 0.9 Celsius has put around 2.8 percent of species at risk of extinction, the study found.

Conspiracy is a strong and inaccurate word on my part. I apologize for that.

The study was pretty good: if we use exactly the same amount of uranium per year as we were in 2013, we'll have 200 years of uranium left.

Nuclear energy in the US right now costs [$.79/kWh](http://www.nei.org/Knowledge-Center/Nuclear-Statistics/Costs-Fuel,-Operation,-Waste-Disposal-Life-Cycle). This includes the cost of storing uranium, but excludes the costs of storing nuclear waste, which is extensively subsidized.

Nuclear waste storage is a major problem for nuclear proponents. First, nuclear waste can't be stored at arbitrary locations, thus storage locations are finite. Second, the US government alone has subsidized nuclear storage costs; because of subsidies, waste storage only costs [$.1 kWh](http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-T-Z/USA--Nuclear-Power-Policy/).

That doesn't make any sense at all.  Yes, breeders will eventually replace current reactors as the latter are decommissioned, but as you point out in the next sentence, energy demand is growing.  That means there's lots and lots of room for breeders.

&gt;Given that the worlds energy demands are constantly increasing, at breeder reactors will help in relation to increasing demand (which, if we used uranium, we'd have less than 200 years worth), 

1.  Again, we are using 1% of the uranium mined for traditional light water reactors.  That 200 years suddenly becomes 20,000 years if we user breeders.  However,

2.  As I've already shown, the 200 year figure is wrong.

&gt;but there's really no evidence that they'd replace urianium.

Yes, there is.  It's happening.  Today, as we converse, Russia's breeder reactor is making fuel from the 99% of uranium that we call ""waste"" today.

&gt;Actually, the costs of extracting [uranium](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2014/ph241/regalbuto2/) from the sea are quite high and not very efficient.

Doesn't matter.  The cost of power from traditional nuclear plants is almost entirely in recouping the initial capital expenditure.  Variable costs (including fuel) are very, very small.  At present, the cost of fuel is less than a cent per kWh.  Uranium could triple in price and traditional nuclear power would still be viable.  Breeders will have essentially zero fuel cost for quite some time as they consume existing waste, then their fuel will *still* be very cheap because they can use nearly all the uranium and thorium mined instead of just the 1% that nuclear plants today use.

&gt;Again, you're trying to say that green technologies aren't viable in the future because they're costly today, but then are trying to claim that anti-green technologies will be viable in the future despite not being viable today.

NO, dammit.  I have never said this.  I called you on this the last time you tried to force those words into my mouth.  Look through our last conversation.

&gt;Nuclear energy in the US right now costs $.79/kWh.

You misread your own source.  The only time the number ""79"" appears, it says 0.79 **cents** per kWh, and that's for fuel.

&gt;Nuclear waste storage is a major problem for nuclear proponents.

Not at all.  What you call waste is fuel for breeder reactors.  It's currently stored in dry casks at nuclear facilities and can stay there quite happily until consumed.

&gt;Second, the US government alone has subsidized nuclear storage costs; because of subsidies, waste storage only costs $.1 kWh.

"3913","cr1xxbg","4","0","t3_357xp3","I'll give it a stab.  First, let me disclose that I am a lukewarmer (i.e., centrist) on this issue.  I welcome any response to what follows.  I think I'll use bullet points to delineate principles of climate change from highest to lowest LOSU (levels of scientific understanding).

1.  Humans emit greenhouse gases like CH4 and CO2 through their use of fossil fuels, as well as through land use changes.  This is trivial to demonstrate.  Human emissions make up about 5% of annual emissions (95% being from natural sources), but that 5% is enough to increase the content over time.

2.  CO2 levels have increased from ~280 ppm in the pre-industrial era to about 400 ppm today.  We can measure this from ice cores.

3.  CO2 (and CH4 and other gases) are greenhouse gases.  We can measure this in the lab.  A container with more CO2, ceteris paribus, will be more opaque to certain wavelengths of infrared.

4.  If we use a Stefan-Boltzmann equilibrium model, we get an increase of ~1°C per doubling of atmospheric CO2.  This concept has a slightly lower LOSU than the previous three ideas, but is very widely accepted.

5.  Feedbacks are generally believed to be net positive.  This is where LOSU drops quite a bit.  For example, it is true that warming will produce more water vapor, which would be a positive feedback since water vapor is a fairly strong greenhouse gas, but the problem is that our understanding of cloud formation is rather poor.  If no clouds form, we get a reasonably strong positive feedback.  If do clouds form, we get a minimal feedback, possibly even a negative feedback.  This area of research spins off into cloud condensation nuclei, which then spins off into areas like aerosols from nature and man as well as cosmic ray modulation via solar activity.  In short, our understanding of feedbacks is pretty poor.

6.  Atmospheric aerosol concentrations, which may block some incoming solar radiation, is poorly understood.  Some recent work by Bjorn Stevens suggests that previous estimates of aerosols were too high; hence, the blocking effect in models is too high; hence, the amount of warming attributable to CO2 is also too high.  This will be a particularly interesting sub-field to watch over the next few years.

7.  The sun was more active during the 20th century than during the last 8,000 years.  If the sun's only effect on climate is total solar irradiance (TSI), then this won't matter much.  If, as some solar researchers suggest, there are augmenting effects that follow changes in solar activity, then the sun's role has been underestimated so far.  There is rather low LOSU in this regard at present.

The science of systems is extremely complex, and climate change involves a very large system.

I get that it's complex. I suppose my question is - how do we know it's not too complex to be known from what we ""know""? ie. 30 years ago, ""a growing consensus"" of scientists were convinced they had it figured out, and they tried to warn of an oncoming Ice Age... It seems like they were wrong.

I still trust science, but ... let me put it another way ...

Did you happen to listen to NPR Planet Money's piece on how doctors determine who gets lungs, when there's a government imposed absence of a market? ... Doctors willingly admitted that they're going to act in the rational best-interests of their patients, at the cost of all other patients, and do things to game the system setup. They were putting patients in ICU ""needlessly"" since admission to the ICU was one of the criteria for moving up the list.

Now, doctors and those who organize these things have removed ICU admission from the criteria, to try and be more objective about the needs.

So, back to trust... I trust science, but how do we know the scientists aren't gaming the system to get their funding. I mean, if you were a research scientists, the last thing you'd really want to do is say ""nope, no problem here, no need for any more money to look into this.""

Re #2-4: those are some of the stats I've seen, and why I generally believe that we do have an issue. However, to what degree it's an issue, I've never really been convinced. I'm open to other data, but is there really a compelling reason to believe that the concentrations will continue to rise and that the net temperature will match? I believe that gets into your points about feedback in the following points.

Re #5: I remember a lecture by Richard Muller, where he referenced cloud formation being part of a negative feedback mechanism. At the time of his comments, I thought he was a skeptic/denier. It turns out, he's done research and established a 501(c)3 to do just the opposite. I respect his opinion and wish I had the time/talents to better examine his research.

Re #6: I agree, that sounds interesting. Any particular reason cited for why he believes the existing estimate were too high?

Re #7: Though, at this point, I may come across as a climate change skeptic, I'm equally as skeptical, perhaps more, of those who claim they can tell me what the activity of the sun has been over the history of the Earth.

"3917","cr22oa7","7","0","t1_cr1z6kh","Well, again, you're talking about the politics of climate change, not the science.  You shouldn't trust anybody in that regard. There's no easy way about it; if you want to understand it, you have to learn about it yourself.  There is no assurance.  There is no way to know anything for certain. 

Science is not scientists saying something.  There was never a time when 'science' or even a 'scientific consensus' thought there was a coming ice age in the 70s. People may have interpreted scientific data to mean that, or, in reality, a very small percentage of laymen decided it would be sensational to interpret a paper or two to mean that, and now in the modern era it's selectively used to hold up one particular side of an argument.  

That story is part of a political discourse designed to prove an argument and sway people to a certain point of view.  Don't listen to people who tell you what 'people said one time' or what 'science says'.  Look at the data.  Learn about the system.  Come to your own conclusions.

Science isn't a thing to be trusted or not trusted.  It's simply a collection of information about observations made of the natural world.  I think where people get confused is when people -- sometimes scientists, sometimes not -- say, 'this is what we should do with this information'.  The science is just the information. 


As far as politics go, they really have no place here, but, as per your last paragraph, even if all scientific data in the world pointed to the non-existence of anthropogenic climate change, climate scientists would still be looking for funding for studying climate.  That's what they're studying.  It doesn't matter what the conclusion is as long as they're making progress in knowledge.  

I hope that helps some, and I hope you don't think I'm busting your balls.

edit: also, a P.S.; I'm not sure where exactly you're coming from, but if what you're trying to get at is that you can't trust anybody who says anything, as in, you think perhaps all the data might be falsified as part of some conspiracy to get funding or whatever, then, like I said, you either have to do all the work yourself, or you simply have to choose at what level you're willing to trust the work of others (that's where peer-reviewed scientific literature comes in handy -- other people do the experiments to try to prove them wrong and find out if it really is 'true' or not) or you have to just accept that you can't believe ANYTHING that anybody does, ever, in which case you and Descartes are gonna get along great.  

And really, it's good to keep a small bit of distrust in the back of your mind, no matter how sure you may feel about something.  Science is about what we've observed.  Gravity is a law because we've observed it behaving the same way on the macro level for so long that we just say, hey man, you know what, that's the way that shit works.  But we could all wake up tomorrow and be floating on the ceiling.  So you never want to be too sure of yourself, even though we have to live our lives to a certain extent as though we are.

"3921","cr24ucc","2","0","t1_cr20715","You are very welcome.  Maybe I can address a few of your questions:

&gt;...is there really a compelling reason to believe that the concentrations will continue to rise...

You are asking the right questions.  It's like that CO2 will continue to rise simply because energy alternatives to fossil fuels are too expensive, too intermittent, and/or too politically unfavorable to replace fossil fuels in a short time frame.  With that said, fossil fuels are finite and each Joule of fossil fuel energy costs just a little more than the previous Joule to extract (on average, of course).  

&gt;...and that the net temperature will match?

This is perhaps the one of the two or three key questions to the whole climate change debate.  CO2 forcing follows a logarithmic curve, so the next 10 ppm of CO2 will have less effect than the prior 10 ppm.  That's why the question of feedbacks is so important.  There were zero net feedbacks, CO2 alone wouldn't be worth worrying about at all; however, if the climate system is dominated by strong positive feedbacks, then we'll have a problem.

&gt;Any particular reason cited for why he believes the existing estimate were too high?

There was huge uncertainty in aerosol history simply because we weren't measuring aerosols 50-100 years ago.  He describes his method briefly in the abstract of his paper:

http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00656.1

Now to be clear, Stevens is very much on the warmist team, but he does believe his research reduces the so-called ""long-tail"" risk.  (This refers to the Gamma distribution of likely climate sensitivity used in most models.  The higher the uncertainty, the longer the tail.)

&gt;but I can't imagine anything that would be so cut and dry.

There's an interesting history of this subject.  In the late 1700s and early 1800s, astronomer William Herschel noticed an inverse correlation between sunspot numbers and wheat prices.  There's more on him here: http://simostronomy.blogspot.com/2013/01/sir-william-herschel-variable-stars.html

Astronomers have been counting sunspots for at least 400 years: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sunspot_Numbers.png

There does seem to be a correlation between lack of sunspots and cold periods.  For example, the Little Ice Age followed the Maunder Minimum.

Here are a couple of other good sources discussing the solar/climate relationship:

http://www2.mps.mpg.de/dokumente/publikationen/solanki/c153.pdf

http://cc.oulu.fi/~usoskin/personal/EOLSS_E6-119-37.pdf

The second one is a book chapter from a scientist named Usoskin who is probably one of the foremost people on the solar/climate interactions.

&gt;if things truly were about to become imminently catastrophic, we'd find a drastic solution that was very expensive, but better than the alternative. 

There are actually a good number of proposed geoengineering solutions.  One is to grind up olivine (which reacts with CO2) and scatter it all over the ground.  Another is to seed the oceans with iron, which would increase algae bloom, which would consume oceanic CO2, which would allow the oceans to act as a huge carbon sink.  Another is to use a fleet of shipborne misters that would spray atomized sea water into the sky to act as cloud condensation nuclei.  Another is to pump SO2 into the stratosphere to act as a reflector.  

One actually could make a decent case that by painting his or her roof white, he or she would be offsetting more incoming radiation than their lifetime CO2 emissions.  In fact, if you look at Google Earth much, you'll see a lot of roof tops in cities are going with a white finish instead of the old tar, a la Shawshank Redemption.

&gt;sometimes I get the impression that those who try to impose all sorts of prevention are deniers themselves - deniers of how the the ""prevention"" affects the lives and livelihood of people who are very much affected by the policies.

That's damn straight brother.  I have little time for those who tell me that energy must become more expensive.

In science, one doesn't just make claims and assert their truth. If one wants to try to counter existing data and conclusions, one must present data and evidence to back it up. Simply stating ""I've proven it wrong"" isn't useful. 

&gt;Doesn't matter. The cost of power from traditional nuclear plants is almost entirely in recouping the initial capital expenditure. 

There's a reason why nuclear power costs $.79 kWh. Sure, if nuclear reactors survived indefinitely, that cost would go down. Nuclear reactors have a shelf-life, just like any other technology. 

&gt;Not at all. What you call waste is fuel for breeder reactors. It's currently stored in dry casks at nuclear facilities and can stay there quite happily until consumed.

Yes, I was off with my units. .75 cents, just for the fuel. The cost, excluding storage, is double that.

Actually, as I stated, the amount of waste is reduced, but the activity of the waste is pretty much the same as from a LWR. In short, the storage problem still persists. As far as medical uses, that amount is negligible.

This will be a particularly interesting sub-field to watch over the next few years.

Let's look at what Bjorn Stevens [concludes](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/04/03/climate-scientist-no-my-study-is-not-a-death-bl/203166) from the study and compare it to what the deniers conclude. 

&gt;Feedbacks are generally believed to be net positive. This is where LOSU drops quite a bit.

&gt;There is rather low LOSU in this regard at present.

Pretty much all the studies show, even the ones that the deniers like to use, that at most 40% of the warming can be attributed to the sun.

Please explain why Russia has one in operation, then, and is building another.  Please explain why the Chinese Academy of Sciences has 400 PhDs working on them.

&gt;That's exactly what you said.

Bullshit.  In our previous conversation I even assumed the price of solar went to zero.  Do try to keep up.

&gt;In science, one doesn't just make claims and assert their truth. 

That's why I gave you a google scholar search that returned literally hundreds of papers showing that uranium production isn't limited to terrestrial sources.  You have no response to that except, ""Nuh uh.""

&gt;There's a reason why nuclear power costs $.79 kWh.

You are **still** having problems with your decimal place, I see.  Your source cited fuel as $0.0079 / kWh.  Nowhere did it claim that the cost per kWh of nuclear power, all things considered, is $0.79 / kWh.  That's literally something you made up.

&gt;Breeder reactors have been abandoned. 

Bullshit.  Russia is building their *second* breeder as we write.  China has 400 PhDs working on them.  There are several companies in the U.S. and Canada working on them.  Your ignorance on this topic is epic.

&gt;Yes, I was off with my units. .75 cents, just for the fuel. The cost, excluding storage, is double that.

So the cost of nuclear is 1.5 cents per kWh?  That's pretty damn cheap.

&gt;Actually, as I stated, the amount of waste is reduced, but the activity of the waste is pretty much the same as from a LWR.

Now you are just talking out of your ass.

&gt;In short, the storage problem still persists. 

Not very good at math, I see.  The small amount of waste from breeders lasts 150-300 years, and some of that is actually useful.  Existing nuclear waste lasts ten thousand years.  You can't seriously compare the two waste handling requirements.

&gt;You're honestly out of your element here. It's amazing.

LOL!  Here's the truth of the whole thing.  Between this conversation and the previous one in another sub, you have shown a complete lack of understanding about nuclear technology, mathematics, and the underlying physics.  All you've done is set up one anti-nuclear talking point after another, which I have then demolished.  You've done nothing except embarrass yourself.  So your claim that *I* don't understand this stuff is nothing short of hilarious.

Fair warning: this is one of those talking points I continually see deniers throw out, as if it nullifies scientific consensus.  But that ignores the fact that the science of climatology, as well as the tools available to study it, have changed and improved drastically since then.  30 years ago, for example, our computing power was in comparative infancy to what it is today.  So was our access to satellites and the sensitive instruments they now carry.  The advancements have been so great that it really doesn't make much sense to compare the time frames.

And, as always, a fundamental principle of science is that all conclusions are conditional, pending convincing evidence to add or contradict that conclusion.  That's what makes science so robust - it can adapt to changing knowledge.

I understand and that's really getting at the heart of my question. How do we know what we know? 30 years ago, we didn't know what we didn't know. Today, with all the - literally, a planet full a variables - with all the variables to consider, how is it that we now are so much more convinced?

I'll throw out some objective observations of my own... 

Meteorologists have gotten incredibly good at short term forecasting. It's really impressive how the SPC can tell me 24 hours ahead of time that there's probably going to be a tornado within this 15 mile radius. So pretty obviously, there's an entirely new degree of precision there, that wasn't even remotely possible 30 years ago.

On the other hand, those same meteorologists still have difficulty with time frames. And forecasting for events that have smaller amounts of historical data (eg. snow in Alabama), they can still be pretty wildly inaccurate.

That said, I understand that the science and the technology have made comparing predictions from decades ago to today's, somewhat an apples and oranges ordeal. 

Maybe I could pose the question this way, since again, I'm not a denier, but I'm skeptical, since there are strong monied interests on ALL sides.

Knowing what we know, do the degree of certainty that we think we know it, is it rational to make the sort of extreme sacrifices necessary (and they are significant sacrifices, both in terms of economics and technology) in order to prevent future catastrophe. 

And if the answer is yes, then my second question becomes to what degree will those sacrifices make a difference? For instance, if a few sacrifices make 90% of the difference, does it make sense to make drastic sacrifices to achieve the additional 10% of difference possible, given the level of certainty or uncertainty of the predicted changes?

And to be clear, I'm talking about and looking for objective scientific reasoning. Just like there is objective, scientific reasoning applied to, say, engineering a space vehicle... You can eliminate some risks, but at some point, you have to be practical and admit that you don't have unlimited resources, time, or knowledge to eliminate all risks... So you do your best.

I think you're forgetting (or didn't realize) that ""climate"" is not the same as ""weather"".  Weather can be somewhat unpredictable due to the clash of variable forces in jet streams, clouds, etc.  But climate is different from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. Climate describes the average of many factors over very long periods of time - 10, 20, 50, 100, etc., years.  Meteorologists have a tough time because they're calculating future events, but when we talk about climate change we begin with what has already happened.  It's a summation of past events, so there isn't the same variation in results.

&gt;Maybe I could pose the question this way, since again, I'm not a denier, but I'm skeptical, since there are strong monied interests on ALL sides.

I think that's an exaggeration, as the climatologists may want better equipment or study grant awards, but we're talking about a few 10s of millions for that versus the HUNDREDS of millions being dumped into climate denial by the likes of ExxonMobil, DonorsTrust and Koch.   Who's really making money?  http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dark-money-funds-climate-change-denial-effort/  

&gt;Knowing what we know, do the degree of certainty that we think we know it, is it rational to make the sort of extreme sacrifices necessary (and they are significant sacrifices, both in terms of economics and technology) in order to prevent future catastrophe. 

It's not ""future"".  We are already seeing the beginnings of the catastrophe, today.  Anomalous weather patterns, droughts, widespread animal extinctions and dramatic sea level rises are just a few of the symptoms.

We could debate the advantages of making drastic sacrifices, but I submit that the people who ought to make the biggest sacrifices are the industrialists, the polluters, the corporations who stand to lose millions if their customers can't feed themselves and are too poor to buy their products.  A little more foresight would help, but at this late date I'm not honestly sure there's anything we can do to stop what's already happening.  We're too addicted to fossil fuels to change anything in time.

I suppose I did conflate the two a bit, but it was just an analogy to say that, yeah, we've gotten better at a lot of stuff. I suppose I could have used advances in dentistry just as well as I could have meteorology.

&gt;Who's really making money?

It's more like, who depend on the money for their living, and when you look at it that way, I'd imagine that Koch industries is a lot more likely to be market-agile than some scientist who has spent 20 years in a very narrow field with little application outside of itself. How many research scientists have the guts to say, ""This is all I know, and now I know that it's not important; take my funding away""? I'd like to think they'd be honest, but one of the very reasons we use science is because we don't trust people.

&gt;We are already seeing the beginnings of the catastrophe, today.

We have different definitions of catastrophe then. I'm not saying your definition is invalid, but I fail to see a dramatic impact on humans and life as we know it - so far. I see more dramatic impact from the regulations (economic impacts, mostly) than I do anything else.

Again, this is not to say your definition is wrong, but when I say catastrophe, I mean, entire populations of people losing their land, or thousands dead due to extreme weather... not some incredibly narrow definition of a unique species dying off with no real impact on the essential food-chain.

&gt;at this late date 

Care to elaborate? Honest question. Why do you consider it a late date? What data convinces you that it's late? Again, it might be. Certainly, if we've done something to change the entire climate of a planet over the last 100 years, that's a LOT of change to turn around... But 100 years ain't so much in geologic time, so, why do you consider it ""late"" in the change?

&gt;We're too addicted to fossil fuels to change anything in time.

Perhaps that's tangential but is anyone really ""addicted""? Like, if something better, cheaper, and more efficient came along, they wouldn't change because somehow they're drawn to their love of burning hydrocarbons? Maybe the geopolitics of it all could be considered an ""addiction"" of sorts (with oil acting as currency, basically) but if someone came along and said ""good news, I've figured out how to manufacture solar arrays that are 100x more efficient,"" wouldn't people be buying up Elon's new battery and going off the grid, like, tomorrow?

This is another of those worn-out red herrings I keep seeing from deniers.  It simply does not add up.

Have you seen the salaries in Earth Science positions at most major universities?  There is NO comparison between the money they're getting, even from grants, and the money the big polluters stand to lose if they are regulated.  In fact, a climate scientist could put himself on easy street if he quit his university job and went to work for a Wall Street firm doing the same kind of data analyses.  Most are choosing to stay.

I wasn't referring to some unknown species of fish in Africa.  We are currently in the midst of the sixth great extinction in earth's history in the past half-billion years.  Natural extinctions occur at a rate of around 1 to 5 species per year. Scientists estimate we’re now losing species at 1,000 to 10,000 times the background rate, with literally dozens going extinct every day.  Rhetorical question: What is happening with our environment that would ratchet up extinctions by factors of 1,000?

http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/biodiversity/elements_of_biodiversity/extinction_crisis/
&gt;Unlike past mass extinctions, caused by events like asteroid strikes, volcanic eruptions, and natural climate shifts, the current crisis is almost entirely caused by us — humans. In fact, 99 percent of currently threatened species are at risk from human activities, primarily those driving habitat loss, introduction of exotic species, and global warming [3]. Because the rate of change in our biosphere is increasing, and because every species’ extinction potentially leads to the extinction of others bound to that species in a complex ecological web, numbers of extinctions are likely to snowball in the coming decades as ecosystems unravel. 


    &gt;Honest question. Why do you consider it a late date? What data convinces you that it's late? 

The IPCC released a report last year that made the case, for one: http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/effects-of-climate-change-irreversible-un-panel-warns-in-report/2014/11/01/2d49aeec-6142-11e4-8b9e-2ccdac31a031_story.html

But, more than that,  I'm referring more to the unwillingness of so many to adjust their profit models or their ways of life in order to lower carbon emissions - even though China recently introduced regulations lowering permissible CO2 emissions, they're still going to be the leading coal consumer and probably the leading contributor to emissions for many years to come.  And, of course, there's the US Congress which features one of the biggest climate deniers (James Inhofe) as chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works - who recently claimed that ""increased carbon in the atmosphere is good for us"".  Do we really have a prayer of enacting reductions in emissions with people like that in charge?  

Carbon reduction is a slow process, but we needed to have started phasing out fossil fuels at least 20 years ago if we didn't want to see 400 ppm CO2 levels today.

I'm not saying it can't be done.  I'm simply being pessimistic, judging by the lack of will and awareness I see - especially in the US - and the amount of damage that's already been done.

http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/have-we-passed-the-point-of-no-return-on-climate-change/

    &gt;Perhaps that's tangential but is anyone really ""addicted""? Like, if something better, cheaper, and more efficient came along, they wouldn't change because somehow they're drawn to their love of burning hydrocarbons? 

This is semantics.  Here in America, too many rural areas (like where I live) rely on petroleum products to transport us and our goods for us to be eager to change quickly.  Business capital change costs money, and with the way crops have been faring the past few years, a lot of farmers just don't have that kind of disposable cash.  Big cities like LA need more public transit, but I don't see them rushing to build it.  We are addicted to fossil fuels because they represent income, mobility, and self-sufficiency to most Americans.

http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/july/sixth-mass-extinction-072414.html

&gt;The scientists also detailed a troubling trend in invertebrate defaunation. Human population has doubled in the past 35 years; in the same period, the number of invertebrate animals – such as beetles, butterflies, spiders and worms – has decreased by 45 percent.

  That's going at it from a different angle by a different set of scientists, but it still points to a very worrisome trend.  If invertebrate populations (not species count) has declined by 45%, that's a whopping huge number.

As for ""wild guesses"", these are the people who actually go into the field and count the different species they observe.  But because there are some 8.74 million (+/-) different species on this planet - and probably more if we want to count different colors of bugs - it's not that easy to be 100% accurate.  We can do what science often does and deal with probabilities and percentages.  That's usually enough to define trends and make reasonable predictions.

&gt; **The LGM that occurred 18 000–20 000 yr ago  represents  a  fascinating  time  when  low  [CO2]  likely constrained  the   physiological   functioning   of   C 3 plants** (Polley et al. ,   1993a;   Dippery et al. ,   1995;   Sage   &amp; Coleman,  2001;  Ward et al. ,  2005;  Lewis et al. ,  2010). **During   that   period,  [CO2]   dropped   to   180–190 ppm** (Petit et al. , 1999; EPICA, 2004), **which is among the lowest  concentrations  predicted  to  have  occurred  during the evolution of land plants** (Berner, 2003, 2006; Tripati et al. , 2009).

I can't stress this enough... Considering the above... Civilization started when co2 was at a geologically record low.  During this time, biodiversity and bio productivity is at a record low in regards to the eras before it.  

The evidence points to a startling conclusion... humanity's contribution to climate change(from the start of the agricultural revolution to now) Is the only thing keeping earth out of an ice age. http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v5/n2/abs/ngeo1358.html

&gt;Assuming that ice growth mainly responds to insolation and CO2 forcing, this analogy suggests that the end of the current interglacial would occur within the next 1500 years, if atmospheric CO2 concentrations did not exceed 240±5 ppmv.

IMO, The massive clear cutting of the forests for farming and fire hunting in the late Pleistocene, near the beginning of civilization, may well have brought earth out of the last glaciation, but the evidence is less certain.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_35fl0x",1431211928,2015-05-09 22:52:08,"FireFoxG"

Here is a site that shows relative strength of the GHGs:

http://www.c2es.org/facts-figures/main-ghgs

CO2 is different from water vapor in one important way: it's non-condensing.  Water vapor can form clouds and fall to the ground, where CO2 doesn't.

The concern people have over CO2 isn't about the direct radiative effect of CO2.  The vast majority of people who study this issue, both skeptics and believers alike, acknowledge that the direct effect of doubling atmospheric CO2 (from 280 ppm to 560 ppm) would be a temperature rise of ~1°C.  This is known as the Stefan-Boltzmann equilibrium.

Where the two groups diverge is over the follow-on effects, or ""feedbacks,"" that result from that warming.  The primary hypothesized positive feedback is more water vapor.  As noted above, it accounts for the largest amount of the greenhouse effect.  So the debate is really around whether that additional water vapor will condense into clouds or remain in the air in an uncondensed state, on average.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_35fl0x",1431273133,2015-05-10 15:52:13,"Will_Power"

No this is what you don't understand, black body radiation. Something at ~300 K will PEAK in emission at 2.5um but it is still emitting across the spectrum. Something at 320 K will PEAK in emission at a shorter wavelength but it will still emit more 2.5 um light that the 300 K body. Black body radiation is a continuum, it doesn't really matter where the peak is. 

Comparing the relative strengths of lines is pointless. We are talking about change. ","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_2vsmmw",1431601422,2015-05-14 11:03:42,"JamieTonight"

&gt; More than a decade ago, scientists watched in awe as Antarctica&amp;#039;s Larsen B Ice Shelf shattered almost completely in just six weeks.

&gt; Evidence from other recent ice shelf disintegrations, like the much smaller Larsen A in 1995 and the 2002 Larsen B collapse, point toward as much as an eight-fold increase in speed of the glaciers that created them-ushering in a potential spike in sea level rise across the globe once fresh ice reaches the ocean.

&gt; Rignot is most concerned about the Ross Ice Shelf and the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, Antarctica&amp;#039;s largest, both of which are bigger than California and more than a thousand feet thick.

&gt; The red line is the status quo - a projection of where emissions will go if no new substantial policy is passed to restrain greenhouse gas emissions.

&gt; Add to all these considerations the high rate of decline in emissions necessary after global emissions peak.

&gt; Now policymakers are being told that emissions can peak in 2030 and still stay under 2&amp;deg;C. To get that result in a modeling scenario, emissions have to fall 6 percent a year for decades, even with large amounts of BECCS thrown in.

By your logic, a paper about slippage on the San Andreas fault would make no mention of possible future earthquakes and their implications. But that's an integral part of that subject.

Also by your logic, a paper about flu strain evolution wouldn't say anything about how the virus might evolve in the future and the implications on vaccine development. And so basically everyone would just proceed as usual and inject patients with an ineffective vaccine. But obviously that makes no sense.

If the authors of past studies on acid rain didn't include predictions for future effects of acid rain on ecosystems and civilian populations, it's possible nobody would have acted to cut emissions that cause acid rain. But that would be silly.

That being said, climate change deniers have to be incredibly selective in order to uphold their argument because there simply isn't much (if any) credible science out there to support the argument that climate change isn't happening/isn't caused by humans. By contrast, there's an incredible amount of science available that supports the opposite. So climate change deniers really do have to be much more selective.

&gt;The ""97%"" studies are so broad as to include most skeptics as well.

The [2004 Oreskes paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/306/5702/1686.full) reviewed all papers between 1993 and 2003 on the subject of global climate change. 75% of the papers agreed that climate change is caused by humans and 25% didn't hold a position either way. There were no papers that rejected AGW. 

[James Powell](http://www.desmogblog.com/2012/11/15/why-climate-deniers-have-no-credibility-science-one-pie-chart) found that of almost 14,000 peer-reviewed climate articles published from 1991-2001, only 24 reject global warming.

[Doran 2009](http://tigger.uic.edu/%7Epdoran/012009_Doran_final.pdf) surveyed almost 3200 earth scientists. 97.5% of the climatologists surveyed agreed that humans are ""a significant factor in global temperature changes."" 

[Anderegg 2012](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/27/12107.abstract) also surveyed climate scientists and found that between 97% and 98% agree that climate change is caused by humans.

Furthermore all of these studies also found that the more papers a scientists has published (aka the more research they've done), the more likely they are to agree that climate change is caused by humans. In other words, the more one looks into it and the more evidence one uncovers, the more convinced one will be that climate change is caused by humans.

&gt; ""Is CO2 a greenhouse gas?"" Duh. ""Do people emit lots of it?"" Double duh.

As mentioned above, the studies didn't ask those questions. They were all quite specific in asking ""are humans contributing to climate change.""

&gt; Climate activists are not listening to that 97% of climate scientists.

Yes they are.

&gt;If they were, they wouldn't be making claims that the science doesn't support.

The science does support it. Go find me 100 publishing climate scientists who reject anthropogenic climate change. ","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_35vj70",1432049714,2015-05-19 15:35:14,"forrey"

&gt;...Furthermore all of these studies also found...

You are taking great pains to demonstrate something I'm not contesting.  It's frustrating to have someone take time to refute something one hasn't said.  I've said that most skeptics agree with the standards of those surveys.  The standards of inclusion in those surveys are so low as to be virtually meaningless.  Most skeptics I've encountered agree that human emitted CO2 is a significant factor in the warming observed over the last century.  Clear?

&gt;As mentioned above, the studies didn't ask those questions.

Sure they do.  The Doran paper asks specifically if human emitted CO2 is a significant factor.  That's something skeptics and warmists agree upon.

&gt;They were all quite specific in asking ""are humans contributing to climate change.""

Yes.  Skeptics generally agree with that.  You seem to be conflating the large pool of skeptics with the kiddie pool of deniers.

&gt;Yes they are.

Bullshit.  Did you follow the link in my edit?  Are those people who are saying ""we are fucked"" listening to climate scientists?  Or are they instead believing their own apocalypse fantasies and pretending those are consistent with climate science?

Let me ask you directly: do you think AGW represents an existential (i.e., threatens our extinction) threat? 

&gt;The science does support it. 

The science supports claims that AGW threatens to destroy all human life?

"4044","cre5rer","2","0","t3_36fl2x","&gt;Can you point me toward one or two books to give me a strong foundation on the current state of our understanding of human-driven climate change, 

I don't want to discourage you, but climate change is such a complex topic that I don't think there is a single book out there that can summarize the field very well, especially as it one that evolves.  Very briefly, the tenets of AGW (anthropogenic global warming) are:

- Humans emit CO2 and other greenhouse gases, and further affect climate by things like land use change and ecosystem alteration.

- Since CO2 change is the largest among those factors it receives most of the focus.  A doubling of atmospheric CO2 (from 280 ppm in pre-industrial times to 560 ppm) should directly result in about a 1°C temperature increase.  This is known as the Stefan-Boltzmann equilibrium.  There is strong agreement on this point.  (For reference, we are near 400 ppm currently.)

- Feedback effects are where the concern lies.  If net feedbacks are strongly positive, then a little warming will be amplified.  If net feedbacks are mildly positive, neutral, or negative, then there isn't much to worry about.  Feedbacks are where the debate lies within the field of climate science.

&gt;and what's to be done about it?

Ah, and here we switch from climate science to policy, and hence politics.  That's why the question of what's to be done is so messy.  There are two general response categories: mitigation and adaptation.

**Mitigation** would include:

- Drastic reductions in CO2 emissions, especially the burning of fossil fuels.

- Sequestering CO2.  This could include iron fertilization of oceans to cause algae blooms to consume excess CO2; enriching soils via things like biochar; planting more trees; pressurizing old oil wells with CO2 where it would calcify underground; and grinding up olivine and letting it react with airborne CO2.

- Geoengineering.  Some CO2 sequestration might be considered geoengineering, but this would be more like pumping SO2 into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight; using a fleet of ships that spray atomized seawater into the atmosphere to act as cloud condensation nuclei; putting reflectors at the L1 Lagrangian point; that kind of thing.

**Adaptation** would include things like:

- Building dikes to reduce risk from storm surges near coastal cities.

- Desalinating sea water for arid areas.

- Limiting development in low-lying areas.

- Intensifying agricultural production in areas threatened by arable land loss.

For the most part, adaptation is the preferred route if expected warming is minimal; mitigation makes more sense if expected warming is large.  Where science really informs this policy choice comes down to feedbacks, which is where the most scientific uncertainty lies, unfortunately.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_36fl2x",1432051418,2015-05-19 16:03:38,"Will_Power"

Doctors used to think that smoking cigarettes was healthy for you and smoking weed could kill you. They have a long history of getting things wrong. Does that mean I'm never listening to another doctor ever again? Of course not. Why? Because unlike climate deniers, doctors understand that analyses and principles change and advance with new evidence and technology. Can doctors still get things wrong? Of course. That's why it's good to get a second (or third) opinion. If you go to 100 doctors and 97 of them give you the same diagnosis, would you listen to them? That's the level of consensus we have on climate change.

&gt; Let's assume for a minute that doctors, mechanics and the like have anythng to do with this topic;

The point is that doctors spend many, many years getting advanced degrees and doing research in order to become experts in their field. They possess huge amounts of knowledge. Mechanics spend less time acquiring knowledge, but they still have a great deal of experience becoming experts. People generally have no problem listening to doctors and mechanics.

Climate scientists also spend many years getting advanced degrees and doing research in order to acquire the knowledge and skills to be experts in their field. And yet, those same people who have no problem accepting the advice of a doctor or mechanic all of a sudden feel totally comfortable saying ""THAT SOUNDS LIKE BULLSHIT TO ME"" even though they possess not even the tiniest fraction of knowledge that a climate scientist has gained through years of work. 

And here's the dumbest part: listening to one single doctor or one single mechanic, there's a fairly good chance you won't get the correct diagnosis. Individual doctors get stuff wrong all the time. Mechanics make mistakes. So do climate scientists. But if you were to be treated by 1,000 doctors or get your car checked by 1,000 mechanics, you better believe they would arrive at the correct consensus simple by the advantage of majority. And yet, *thousands* of climate scientists (and scientists from hundreds of other related fields) all give us the same diagnosis and deniers are still vain enough to say ""naaahhh I definitely know better than all those fuckers."" Even though that denier, if he/she sat down at a table of scientists, probably wouldn't understand a single word they said because he/she has spent approximately 0 hours acquiring the advanced technical skills that a scientist possesses.

But sea ice is also an important factor too, especially sea ice shelves which help to slow down land ice as it flows towards the ocean.  We have been losing some very prominent sea ice shelves around Antarctica.  We've been losing land ice too, especially around the Greenland area.  If you look at just the Arctic, you'd see a very dire picture of ice recession.  

Probably the only single measurement that looks at all healthy is sea ice extent (which is what this article has chosen to focus on).  Sea ice extent is on a upward trend because of what's happening down in Antarctica.  Antarctica has a very wide ring of sea ice all around it, wider than it's ever been.

Does that mean global warming isn't real or that the earth is cooling?  No.  The oceans around Antarctica are warming and the thickness of multi-decade ice is shrinking.  So where does this vast, but thin ice apron come from?  Climate scientists are still working on that, there's a lot about our climate that we just don't understand yet.  I believe the prevailing theory at the moment has to do with a local low pressure system hanging out down there and really strong cyclonic winds which are creating favorable conditions for the formation of a surface ice layer.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_36m2ie",1432131686,2015-05-20 14:21:26,"pocketfrog77"

&gt; The paper confirms that as carbon emissions continue to climb, so too has the Earth&amp;#039;s capacity to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

&gt; For Dr. Houghton, &amp;quot;There is no question that land and oceans have, for at least the last five and half decades, been taking up about half of the carbon emitted each year. The outstanding question is, Why? Most of the processes responsible for that uptake would be expected to slow down as the Earth warms, but we haven&amp;#039;t seen it yet. Since the emissions today are three times higher than they were in the 1960s, this increased uptake by land and ocean is not only surprising; it&amp;#039;s good news. Without it, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere would be twice what it is, and climate change would be much farther along. But, there&amp;#039;s no guarantee that it will continue.""

&gt; Dr. Houghton and colleagues conclude that the greater certainty in atmospheric carbon measurements has led to an increased certainty in the calculated rate of carbon uptake by land and oceans.

The short and sweet of it is that sea ice gains in the southern hemisphere have largely offset any sea ice losses in the northern. Climate models [predicted](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/SeaIce/page4.php) that warming temperatures would lead to less antarctic sea ice, not more. The discrepancy has spawned a variety of theories.

"4077","crg59ig","1","0","t3_36niul","Global sea ice extent is probably the only healthy ice measurement we have, as there is quite a large area of sea ice down in Antarctica just now.  This massive growth of surface sea ice has tipped the global average into an upward trend, masking the catastrophic decline we've been seeing in the Arctic.

HOWEVER, what's important to keep in mind is that you don't really get a complete picture of what's going on just by looking at sea ice area.  It's much more telling to look at sea ice volume.

You see, the thing about all that ice down in Antarctica, is that most of it is very, very thin.  That kind of ice forms quickly, but also melts quickly too and will be entirely gone once summer hits.  If you were to look at multi-decade ice, the kind that hangs out stubbornly through summer, the kind that stacks up around that continent to help hold back Antarctica's land glaciers, well that kind of ice IS declining as the ocean waters beneath them warm.  Remember hearing about the collapse of the Larsen B ice shelf?  A massive chunk of it shattered about a decade ago and was gone in less than 6 weeks.  NASA scientists say we'll lose what's left of that shelf in under five years.  The Larsen B ice shelf was 10,000 years old.

Based on current melt rates, it looks like Larsen C, (150,000 years old) will be next to go.  There's a massive crack in it and it's melting away both from above and from underneath.  There are other ice shelves that are of concern now as well, and land ice volume has been declining too.  

So why have we got all this crappy, thin sea ice forming around the Antarctic, if all the good, important thick ice is in decline?  Climate scientists aren't particularly sure, but the going theory is that there's quite a lot of cyclonic wind blowing around down there which shoves sea ice together, and creates favorable conditions for its formation. 

The fact that this article focuses exclusively on global sea ice area, and tries to draw all it's conclusions from just this one healthy measurement, is quite misleading.  One might even call it intentionally dishonest.

Doctors and mechanics do have many years experience to back them up. NASA does not when the topic is an area new to research. NASA is very good at launching satelittes and they have a good track record. That does not make them expert on the long-term behaviour of antarctic ice.

Today's ""climate scientists"" are in on the ground floor because there was no such industry as ""climate science"" until AGW came along to peak interest. Without such interest there had been no great push, or funding, for on-going climate research. So, lacking anything that resembles a long-term data-set the newly created discipline makes pronouncements and predictions that have been, predictably, fallacious. None of the predictions generated by AGW have borne out and none of the predictions concerning antarctic ice have borne out either. For some strange reason AGW believers put more faith in failure than success.

The link you provide does not support your claim:

&gt;*The variability in Antarctic sea ice patterns in different sectors and from year to year makes it difficult to predict how Antarctic sea ice extent could change as global warming from greenhouse gases continues to warm the Earth. Climate models predict that Antarctic sea ice will respond more slowly than Arctic sea ice to warming, but as temperatures continue to rise, a long-term decline is expected.*

&gt;*You might wonder why the negative trends in Arctic sea ice seem to be more important to climate scientists than the smaller increase in Antarctic ice. Part of the reason, of course, is simply that the size of the increase is much smaller and slightly less certain than the Arctic trend. Another reason, however, is that the complete summertime disappearance of Northern Hemisphere ice would be a dramatic departure from what has occurred throughout the satellite record and likely throughout recorded history. In the Antarctic, however, sea ice already melts almost completely each summer. Even if it completely disappeared in the summer, the impact on the Earth’s climate system would likely be much smaller than a similar disappearance of Arctic ice.*

&gt;*You might also wonder how Antarctic sea ice could be increasing, even a little bit, while global warming from greenhouse gases is raising the planet’s average surface temperature. It’s a question scientists are asking, too. One reason may be that other atmospheric changes are softening the influence of global warming on Antarctica. For example, the ozone hole that develops over Antarctica each spring actually intensifies a perpetual vortex of winds that circles the South Pole. The stronger this vortex becomes, the more isolated the Antarctic atmosphere becomes from the rest of the planet. In addition, ocean circulation in the Antarctic behaves differently than it does in the Arctic. Around Antarctica, warm water moves downward in the ocean’s water column, making sea ice melt from warm water less likely.*

The fact is that Antarctica sea ice (which is very thin) is growing *despite* Southern Ocean temperatures going up. In other words, Antarctic sea ice rising isn't an argument against global warming, even though it is routinely presented as such by contrarians and deniers.","t5_2rawx","climatechange","t3_36niul",1432324663,2015-05-22 19:57:43,"archiesteel"

NASA's research has shown that Antarctic sea ice extent is growing in spite of warmer Southern Ocean temperatures. So the ice is growing even if temperatures are rising.

I understand your confusion, given that this is counter-intuitive, but the fact remains that the dynamis of Antarctic sea ice are fundamentally different from Arctic sea ice, no matter how much some people try to argue that they are similar.

In the 1500s pack ice extended far out into the Atlantic and there was no way to approach the passage. By the 1600s the ice had retreated and ships got as far as the entrance to Hudson’s Bay. By the 1700s crude mapping of the northern shores of North America was possible, but the passage was not yet open. In the 1920s the passage was finally open, but only briefly because the swing to cool ENSO conditions caused the pack ice to thicken once again. That takes us up to the 1970s. 

We have very little hard data for either polar region outside of that which has been amassed over the last 50-odd years. Information from prior to that is based on historical records and archeological research. We know that the ice has advanced and retreated many times from the waves of people moving through the north. People don't migrate towards areas of greater hardship, only towards promising areas. 

So, we can see that the extensive icepack of the LIA has retreated to what we see today.

It's not incorrect... It's just that the author thinks that deniers can use science to back up an argument... so the science should follow the consensus and not objective reality, because apparently the message is more important then reality.

Then they go on to basically debunk the alarm about global warming in order to make a case that this could still be bad news.

&gt;Another factor, already implied above but I’ll underscore it, is the fact that moving towards warmer conditions does not remove colder conditions. The mortality induced by cooler ambient temperatures discussed in this paper is not from people freezing to death on ice flows. It is from ambient temperatures mostly above freezing, which in the absence of a technological fix, cause added stress. Even with increased surface temperatures caused by global warming, these conditions will still persist. The range of temperatures over which this cold induced stress occurs is, as stated, very large and even if overnight temperature minima rise with global warming in a given region, most of those temperatures will still be regularly represented.

&gt; &amp;quot;The signal of future glacier change in the region is clear: continued and possibly accelerated mass loss from glaciers is likely, given the projected increase in temperatures,&amp;quot; said Joseph Shea, a glacier hydrologist at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development in Nepal, and leader of the study published in The Cryosphere, the journal of the European Geosciences Union.

&gt; The team studied glaciers in the Dudh Kosi basin in the Nepal Himalaya, which is home to some of the world&amp;#039;s highest mountain peaks, including Mount Everest, and to over 400 sq km of glacier area.

&gt; While increased glacier melt initially increases water flows, ongoing retreat leads to reduced meltwater from the glaciers during the warmer months.

How many times have AGW skeptics suffered that accuation? People can be comfortably grouped into four categories when it comes to AGW. 

1.Those who are up on the latest research and accept AGW on scientific grounds - AGW promoters

2.Those who ae up on the latest research and reject AGW on scientific grounds -AGW skeptics

3.Those who know nothing of the science but accept AGW as that seems to be the way to go based on media reports or their own political views - AGW believers

4.Those who know nothing of the science but reject AGW as that seems to be the way to go based on their own political views - AGW deniers

Of those four groups #3 &amp; #4 are the most numerous, and neither bases their opinions on knowledge of science. The AGW promotion community wants to apply the word ""denier"" to anyone with a question or a confounding observation. It's easy to assume that anyone who questions current climate science must be anti-environment. That's made even easier with so many pro-AGW sites promoting the idea. 

I've been in contact with a lot of skeptics. Not one has no care for the environment. What we do see is a serious concern for the veracity of AGW. In a nutshell, science is in the process of being whored to financial and political interests that determine results and policy.
